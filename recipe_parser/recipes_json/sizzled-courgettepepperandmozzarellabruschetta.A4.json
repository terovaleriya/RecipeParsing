Bruise the (peeled) garlic clove with a rolling pin and add to the cold pan. Put on a low heat and cook slowly, stirring now and then, for 5 minutes. The garlic should gently fizz, but not colour. Remove the garlic, turn the heat up slightly and add the bread in a single layer (in batches if needed, adding a little more oil). Fry for 1-2 minutes on each side, until golden. Transfer to a plate and keep warm."}, {"step": "Return the pan to a medium-high heat and add 2 tbsp oil.
