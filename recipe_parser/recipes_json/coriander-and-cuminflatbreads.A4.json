Put the all the ingredients apart from the oil into a mixing bowl and toss together. Add the oil then weigh out 150g just-boiled water and add it to the mixture. Bring everything together into a smooth dough and knead briefly. Return the dough to the bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Set aside for 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax and make it easier to roll out."}, {"step": "Once rested, divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Dust the worktop liberally with flour and roll each portion out into a thin disc, about 20-22cm in diameter. Set the flatbreads to one side; try not to stack them on top of each other or they may stick. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. Once the pan is hot, shake off any excess flour from a flatbread and add to the pan; dry-fry for 40 seconds or so per side until punctuated with dark specks of char. Repeat with the remaining flatbreads. Stack the fried flatbreads between 2 plates or in a tea towel to keep them soft. Serve warm."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per flatbread 887kJ 211kcals", "Fat": "5.7g", "Saturated Fat": "0.8g", "Carbohydrate": "34g", "Sugars": "0.5g", "Protein": "4.8g", "Salt": "0.9g", "Fibre": "2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/Coriander-flatbreads.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
