Increase the heat to high, add the milk and vanilla and bring to the boil for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat. Add the icing sugar and whisk until smooth. Working quickly, spread the cupcakes with the caramel fudge frosting and allow to set. If the frosting hardens before all the cakes are iced, place the saucepan over a medium heat and stir until the frosting is melted and smooth enough to spread again."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1828.408kJ 437kcals", "Fat": "20.6g", "Saturated Fat": "13g", "Carbohydrate": "59.4g", "Sugars": "46.5g", "Salt": "0.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/Picture 1301.png/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
