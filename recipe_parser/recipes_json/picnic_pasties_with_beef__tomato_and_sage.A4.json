Roll each pastry block into a large rectangle about 40cm x 30cm. Cut out 12 x 10-12cm discs, using a saucer as a template. Place on 2 baking sheets lined with baking parchment, and chill in the fridge until needed.  Reserve 12 sage leaves and finely chop the rest. Cut the defrosted, diced squash in half again and mix together with the Bolognese sauce and chopped sage.  Brush the edges of the pastry discs with a little beaten egg. Spoon 1-2 tbsp of the Bolognese mixture into the centre of each disc. Fold the pastry in half over the filling then use a fork to press down and seal the edges.  Dip the reserved sage leaves in the beaten egg and place one on each pasty before brushing the pastry top with the egg wash. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes until golden. Serve with rocket salad and cherry tomatoes."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "3255.152kJ 778.0kcal", "Fat": "52.0g", "Saturated Fat": "20.6g", "Sugars": "5.5g", "Salt": "1.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/3Empanadas4_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
