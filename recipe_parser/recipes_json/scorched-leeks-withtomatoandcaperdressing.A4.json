Steam over briskly simmering water for 6-8 minutes (or 10-12 minutes if very thick), until tender to the point of a knife. Drain well and pat dry with kitchen paper. Coat with 1 tbsp olive oil and season."}, {"step": "Put a non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Add the leeks in a single layer (in batches if necessary) and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side, turning with tongs until well-coloured all over. Remove to a plate and keep warm. Wipe the pan out with kitchen paper."}, {"step": "Return the pan to a high heat with the remaining 1 tbsp olive oil. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook briskly for about 3 minutes, tossing the pan, until beginning to char and soften. Add the capers and garlic to the pan and cook for 30 seconds, then add the red wine vinegar. Allow to cook for a minute or so, until very little liquid remains. Remove the pan from the heat and add the extra virgin olive oil and basil; season. The cherry tomatoes should by now have softened to make a rough dressing. Spoon over the cooked leeks to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "678kJ 164kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "2g", "Carbohydrate": "5.7g", "Sugars": "4.7g", "Protein": "2.7g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "3.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Scorched-leeks-with-caper-dressing.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
