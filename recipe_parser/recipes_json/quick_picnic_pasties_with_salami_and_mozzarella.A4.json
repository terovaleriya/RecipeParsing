Tip the tomatoes into a small roasting tin, scatter the basil and garlic over and drizzle with the oil. Season and roast for 10 minutes until the tomatoes have softened and just split but are still keeping their shape.  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to make a 38cm square. Trim the edges then cut the pastry into four equal squares.  Cut the salami slices into 1cm-wide strips. Pat the cheese dry with clean kitchen paper to remove the excess moisture, then dice.  Divide the cheese, roasted tomatoes with their juices, and salami between the pastry squares. Brush the edges with some of the beaten egg. Pull the corners up to meet in the centre and, using your thumb, press along the edges of the pastry to seal the joins and make neat parcels. Transfer the pasties to a non-stick baking sheet and brush with more egg.  Bake the pasties for 15-20 minutes until puffed and golden brown. Serve warm or cold with Little Gem lettuce leaves."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2974.824kJ 711.0kcal", "Fat": "53.7g", "Saturated Fat": "21.1g", "Sugars": "3.9g", "Salt": "2.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/q/6-picnic-pastie00019_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
