Spread the brioche slices with a thin layer of the butter and place on a baking tray.  Cook in the oven for 7-8 minutes or until golden and crisp around the edges. Meanwhile, prepare the mushrooms.  Trim the ends, separate the long thin varieties into smaller clumps and slice the larger ones lengthways.  Heat a large frying pan over a high heat.  When hot, add the remaining butter and the mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, for 4-5 minutes until golden. Mash the goat's cheese with the yogurt until smooth, season to taste, then sprinkle with plenty of extra thyme leaves.  Divide the mushrooms between the toasts and serve with the goat's cheese yogurt to spoon over."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,383kj 333kcals", "Fat": "24.5g", "Saturated Fat": "15.7g", "Carbohydrate": "17.8g", "Sugars": "5.3g", "Protein": "10.2g", "Salt": "0.9g", "Fibre": "2.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/MushroomsOnToast&GoatsCheese_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
