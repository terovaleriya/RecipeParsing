Put the oil in a flameproof casserole dish or deep-sided frying pan and set over a low-medium heat. Add the fennel and leeks with a pinch of salt. Cook over a low heat, stirring often, for 15 minutes, until softened. Check through the mussels and discard any open ones that donâ€™t close when tapped on a hard surface."}, {"step": "Halve the tomatoes, add them to the pan together with the garlic and cook for a further minute. Turn the heat up to high and pour in the wine. Bubble down for a few seconds, then add the saffron and its liquid, along with the mussels and halibut. Cover and turn the heat down to low.
