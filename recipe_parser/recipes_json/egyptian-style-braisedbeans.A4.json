Cover with a lid and bake for 2 hours."}, {"step": "Remove from the oven: the beans should now be nice and soft. Mash lightly with the back of a fork or a potato masher. Stir in the lemon juice and check the seasoning. They’re ready to eat now, or they taste even better reheated the next day."}, {"step": "To serve, warm the beans on the hob (if necessary), adding a splash of water to loosen. Mix the tahini in a bowl with 2-4 tbsp warm water until the consistency of single cream; season and set aside. Toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, then roughly crush in a pestle and mortar. Spoon the beans into shallow bowls with some tahini spooned over the top, plus a generous drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of crushed cumin seeds and a scattering of chopped parsley. Serve with the toasted pitta bread for scooping up and lemon wedges for squeezing over."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,188kJ 522kcals", "Fat": "17g", "Saturated Fat": "2.6g", "Carbohydrate": "58g", "Sugars": "4.5g", "Protein": "22g", "Salt": "1.6g", "Fibre": "21g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/e/Egyptian-style-braised-beans.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
