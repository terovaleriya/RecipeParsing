Beat the butter with the mustard, tarragon, lemon zest and seasoning. Remove ⅔ of this butter and set aside. With your fingers ease the skin away from the chicken breast taking care not to tear it. Push the reserved butter under the skin, covering as much of the breast as possible and ease the skin back in place. Spread the remaining butter over the skin on the thighs and thoroughly wash your hands. Roast the chicken for 1¼ hours, or according to pack instructions until the skin is golden and the juices run clear from the thigh when pierced with a skewer. Transfer the chicken to a warm serving platter and leave to rest for 5 minutes."}, {"step": "Half an hour before the chicken is ready, place the potatoes in a pan of cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer until tender - about 15-18 minutes - then drain and return to the pan for 1 -2 minutes to dry out. Push through a sieve or vegetable mouli for a really smooth purée and return to the pan. Push the potato to the side and add the milk and seasoning. Heat until simmering then beat into the potatoes with 2 -3 tbsp of the juices from the cooked chicken. Pile into a warm serving dish, make a shallow hollow in the top and put the reserved extra butter into it."}, {"step": "Carve the chicken and serve with the pomme purée."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,283kJ 545kcals", "Fat": "27.8g", "Saturated Fat": "10.2g", "Carbohydrate": "34.8g", "Sugars": "1.9g", "Protein": "39g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "2.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/Tarragon-&-mustard-chicken_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
