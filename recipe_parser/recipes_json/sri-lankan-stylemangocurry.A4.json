{"title": "Sri Lankan-style mango curry", "tags": null, "planning": {"prep_time": "PT10 minutesM", "cook_time": "PT30-35 minutesM", "total_time": "PT45 minutesM", "serves": "2 as a main or 6 as a side dish"}, "ingredients": [{"item": "2 tbsp vegetable oil or coconut oil"}, {"item": "1 tsp mustard seeds"}, {"item": "2 shallots, sliced"}, {"item": "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped"}, {"item": "¼ tsp chilli powder"}, {"item": "½ tsp ground turmeric"}, {"item": "1 tbsp medium curry powder"}, {"item": "½ tsp amchoor powder, plus extra to taste"}, {"item": "1 tsp caster sugar"}, {"item": "½ tbsp dried curry leaves"}, {"item": "2 large firm, unripe mangoes"}, {"item": "250ml unsweetened coconut drink or 150ml coconut milk and 100ml water"}, {"item": "½ green chilli, finely sliced, to serve"}, {"item": "Coriander, to serve"}], "instructions": [{"step": "Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the mustard seeds, shallots and garlic to the oil and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring often."}, {"step": "Add the remaining spices, along with the sugar, curry leaves and a large pinch of flaked sea salt to the softened shallot mixture and stir well to combine. Cook for a further 2 minutes to begin to fry the spices."}, {"step": "Wash and slice the mango into strips using a sharp knife, leaving the skin on. The skin helps the mango hold its shape once cooked. Discard the stones and add the mango pieces to the saucepan, tossing to coat in the spice mixture."}, {"step": "Pour in the coconut drink (or milk mixture) and stir well. Cover with a lid and allow the curry to simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally. When the curry is ready, the mango should be tender but not falling apart and the sauce will have thickened. Taste the sauce – if it is too sweet, add a little salt or amchoor powder. Garnish with sliced green chilli. Serve hot with basmati rice and coriander, or as a side dish as part of a big meal."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,775kJ 427kcals", "Fat": "27g", "Saturated Fat": "14g", "Carbohydrate": "37g", "Sugars": "33g", "Protein": "3.8g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "8.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Sri-Lankan-Mango-Curry (1).jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
