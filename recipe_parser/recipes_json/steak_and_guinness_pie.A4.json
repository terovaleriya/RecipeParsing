Drain the meat (keep the marinade), coat in the flour; season. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan; brown half the ox cheeks. Set aside, wipe the pan, then brown the rest.  Heat 1 tbsp oil in a casserole; cook the onions and lardons for 10 minutes. Stir in the meat, marinade and herbs, tomato purée and worcestershire sauce; season. Cover; simmer for 2 hours 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Allow to cool.  Preheat the oven to 200c, gas mark 6. Fry the mushrooms in the butter over a high heat for 4 minutes. Spoon, with the stew, into a 20cm x 30cm pie dish. On a floured surface, roll the pastry out a bit larger than the dish; top the pie with the pastry and cut a cross in it. Trim away the excess and press down around around the edges. Brush with egg.  Bake for 45 minutes until the pastry is puffed and gravy bubbles at the edges. Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2727.968kJ 652.0kcal", "Fat": "35.0g", "Saturated Fat": "14.5g", "Sugars": "4.5g", "Salt": "1.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/201011ed46r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
