Strain, reserving the liquor. Put the liquor and chicken stock in a pan and bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down to low. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil and ½ the butter. Add the onion, garlic, soaked mushrooms, fennel and celery. Season with a little salt. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes. The vegetables should be soft and giving."}, {"step": "Add the rice, thyme and bay leaf and stir to coat completely in the onion and mushroom mixture. Add the wine and reduce by 1 /3. Start to ladle the hot stock into the rice, stirring as the rice absorbs the stock, then add a little more. Keep this process going for about 20 minutes."}, {"step": "Once the rice has got to where you want it (it should have a little texture and there should be movement), add most of the grated parmesan and the remaining butter. Season but remember the parmesan is salty. Leave for a couple of moments to rest and gather itself. Top with the parsley and remaining parmesan then serve with some lovely beaujolais or a crisp white wine such as a riesling."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,750kJ 661kcals", "Fat": "46g", "Saturated Fat": "19.5g", "Carbohydrate": "41g", "Sugars": "4.1g", "Protein": "15.9g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "4.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Mushroom-risotto.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
