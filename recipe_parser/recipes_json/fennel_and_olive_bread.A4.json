Mix to a soft dough, then transfer to a floured worksurface. Knead for 6-8 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  Knead in the olives until evenly distributed. Place in a clean, oiled bowl and cover with a clean tea towel. Set aside in a warm place for 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.  Turn the dough out onto the worksurface and knead again briefly. Shape into a sausage shape about 32cm long and slash the top a few times with a sharp knife. Transfer to a lightly oiled baking sheet. Scatter the rest of the fennel seeds and a little flaked sea salt over the top. Drizzle over the rest of the oil. Cover with a tea towel and leave to rise again for 20 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 230°C, gas mark 8. Bake the loaf for 30-35 minutes, until risen and golden, and it sounds hollow when tapped on the base. Cool on a wire rack before slicing."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1058.552kJ 253.0kcal", "Fat": "5.9g", "Saturated Fat": "0.8g", "Sugars": "1.5g", "Salt": "0.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/f/0911ss0026.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
