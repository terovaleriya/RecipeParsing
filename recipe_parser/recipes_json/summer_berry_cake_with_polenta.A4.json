Line a 24cm square or 27cm round shallow cake tin with baking parchment. Cream the butter and 175g of the sugar with a wooden spoon until pale and fluffy.  Add the beaten egg and polenta and beat again until well combined. Stir in the ground almonds, vanilla extract and baking powder. Using a metal spoon, fold in half each of the raspberries and blueberries with the lemon zest.  Spoon the cake mixture into the tin and level with the back of the spoon. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until golden and when a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean.  Meanwhile, prepare the syrup by heating the lemon juice with the remaining 50g sugar, either in a microwave on high for 2-3 minutes or by boiling in a small saucepan for 1-2 minutes until syrupy. Make small holes over the surface of the cake with a skewer and pour the warm syrup evenly over while the top of the cake whilst still hot.  For a picnic, leave the cake to cool completely in the tin. If serving as a dessert, serve the warm cake inverted and cut into squares, with some single cream and the reserved raspberries and blueberries."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1025.08kJ 245.0kcal", "Fat": "14.7g", "Saturated Fat": "6.7g", "Sugars": "17.3g", "Salt": "0.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Image-0126_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
