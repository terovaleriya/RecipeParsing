Boil for 15–20 minutes, until soft. Drain and mash. Season, stir in the olive oil and keep warm.  Meanwhile, place the walnuts, Parmesan and garlic in a food processor and whiz. Add the oil and tarragon and whiz again, until the mixture forms a coarse paste. Season and set aside.  Heat a ridged pan or grill until very hot. Season the steaks and, depending on how thick they are, cook for about 2–3 minutes on each side for rare, 4 minutes for medium or 5 minutes for well done. Serve with the sweet potato mash and a good dollop of walnut pesto."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "3422.512kJ 818.0kcal", "Fat": "48.8g", "Saturated Fat": "11.2g", "Sugars": "13.7g", "Salt": "1.0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/f/0612126-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
