Cook for 4-5 minutes until golden brown. Add the maple syrup, and cook for a further minute until slightly thickened. Pour into a large bowl, cover and leave to cool slightly before putting it into the freezer for 25 minutes, or until it’s starting to firm up. Whisk with a hand mixer for about 1 minute, or until pale and creamy. Keep cool."}, {"step": "Place the pancake ingredients other than the butter, oil and pancetta into a large bowl. Whisk together gradually into a smooth batter. Set aside."}, {"step": "Warm a frying pan over a high heat. Add a little oil and the pancetta, in batches if necessary, and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until crisp. Remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper and keep warm."}, {"step": "Discard the oil and wipe out the pan with kitchen paper. Return to the heat. Add a knob of butter and a little oil. When the butter melts and starts to froth, ladle in enough batter to make a single pancake about 18-20cm in size. Cook for about 2 minutes, until small bubbles start bursting on the surface and the base is golden. Turn over using a fish slice. Cook for a further minute, or until golden. Keep warm and repeat with the remaining batter to make 4-6 pancakes, adding more butter and oil as needed. Serve hot with the bacon and maple butter."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,185kJ 523kcals", "Fat": "30.9g", "Saturated Fat": "16.5g", "Carbohydrate": "49.9g", "Sugars": "16.8g", "Protein": "11.4g", "Salt": "1.8g", "Fibre": "1.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/Waitrose-Weekend_WK320_WkEnd-Menu_Sat-Brunch_Pancakes-Maple-Butter-Crispy-Bacon.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
