Using electric beaters, cream the sugar and butter in a mixing bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the orange zest, crushed cardamom seeds and salt. Sift in the flour and use a wooden spoon or spatula to combine."}, {"step": "Bring the dough together with your hands (it will be a little crumbly) and place on a large sheet of baking parchment. Cover with another layer of parchment and roll out the dough, between the sheets, to a thickness of about 1.5cm. Chill for 30 minutes."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 170˚C, gas mark 3. Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out further to a thickness of about 0.3cm. Remove the top layer of parchment and place on a large baking tray. Stamp out biscuits using a 6cm cutter and carefully transfer to the lined baking tray. (Re-roll any scraps of dough to make more biscuits; you may need to bake them in batches.) Sprinkle with the extra golden caster sugar and bake for 14-15 minutes, until light-golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "366kJ 88kcals", "Fat": "4.7g", "Saturated Fat": "2.9g", "Carbohydrate": "10g", "Sugars": "3.8g", "Protein": "0.9g", "Salt": "0.07g", "Fibre": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/o/Orange-&-cardamom-shortbread-biscuits.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
