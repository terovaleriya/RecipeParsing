Grease 6 x 150ml dariole moulds or other similar-sized small, ovenproof dishes. Line the bases with discs of baking parchment and then line the sides with a strip of paper. (Don’t worry about completely lining the sides, though – the paper is used to help lift the cooked cheesecakes out of the tins.)  Put the cookies in a plastic food bag and crush with a rolling pin. Tip into a bowl and stir in the butter until mixed. Divide among the tins and pack down with a teaspoon so the mixture lines the base and slightly up the sides.  Melt the white chocolate in the microwave on medium power for 2-3 minutes, stirring once, or over a bowl of gently simmering water. Beat the soft cheese and eggs together in a separate bowl. Grate 50g of the plain chocolate into another small bowl and stir in the coffee powder and 2 tablespoons boiling water. Leave until melted.  Stir the soft cheese mixture into the melted white chocolate to mix. Spoon most of the mixture into the tins. Spoon the dark chocolate mixture around the edges of the tins, then add the remaining white chocolate mixture.  Bake the cheesecakes for 15 minutes. (They should still be very wobbly in the centre.) Leave until cold then remove from the tins and chill. Whip the cream until peaking and spoon a little on top of each. Pare curls off the remaining piece of plain chocolate and scatter over the cheesecakes to decorate. Serve with a little single cream."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2573.16kJ 615.0kcal", "Fat": "45.6g", "Saturated Fat": "26.7g", "Sugars": "35.6g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/0901ws30-r2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
