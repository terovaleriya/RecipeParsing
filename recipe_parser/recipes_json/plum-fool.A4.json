Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and cook, stirring now and again, for 12-15 minutes until completely soft. Tip the mixture into a large sieve set over a bowl and press through as much of the fruit and juices as possible; discard any pulp and skin. Stir the lemon zest and juice into the fruit with a small pinch of salt. Leave to cool completely."}, {"step": "Whip the double cream to soft peaks and gently fold in the icing sugar. Very gently fold in ½ the plum mixture, but don’t over-combine (the aim is a marbling, rather than uniform colour). Layer the fruity cream, remaining plum mixture and crumbled biscuits into glasses or glass bowls, finishing with a little plum mixture and biscuit. Top with the plum slices and serve straight away."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,345kJ 565kcals", "Fat": "43g", "Saturated Fat": "26g", "Carbohydrate": "41g", "Sugars": "35g", "Protein": "2.4g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "3.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/Plum-fool.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
