Crush in a pestle and mortar with 10g flaky sea salt to a mostly fine powder, then mix through the remaining 15g salt. Pat the pork dry with kitchen paper. Remove the string and set aside, then use a sharp knife to define the scores in the skin. Rub the spice rub generously all over the pork. Put on a tray, uncovered, for 30 minutes."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 180˚C, gas mark 4. Cut the onions into wedges then scatter in a deep roasting tin with the garlic, sage, celeriac and bay leaves; nestle the apples in the centre.

Tip in the flour and cook, whisking, for 3-4 minutes, until just starting to catch. Add the calvados (or brandy) and boil rapidly, scraping the base of the pan, until thickened again. Add the stock and bubble, whisking, for 4-5 minutes. Stir in any meat resting juices and simmer briskly for 4-5 minutes until thickened; season and keep warm.
