Remove from the heat and transfer about ¹⁄³ of the mixture to a small bowl, leaving the rest in the pan."}, {"step": "Using electric beaters, whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt together in a clean mixing bowl until holding soft peaks. In a second bowl, using the same beaters, beat the egg yolks, ricotta and milk. Beat in the flour and baking powder until smooth. Fold in the egg whites, then fold in the cranberries from the bowl."}, {"step": "Return the cranberry pan to a low heat with 30g butter and the remaining 75ml syrup to warm through. Meanwhile, put a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add a little of the remaining 20g butter; when foaming, drop in 3 heaped tbsp batter to make 3 pancakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until just set. Keep warm while cooking the rest. Spoon some compote over each stack, adding more syrup and some yogurt, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,116kJ 506kcals", "Fat": "24g", "Saturated Fat": "13g", "Carbohydrate": "52g", "Sugars": "27g", "Protein": "18g", "Salt": "0.9g", "Fibre": "6.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/200930_013C_CranberryIceCream_Pancakes1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
