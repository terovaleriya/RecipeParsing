Put the strawberries, 90g sugar and the strip of zest in a medium pan. Set over a low-medium heat, stirring often, until the mixture begins to bubble and the sugar dissolves. Turn the heat up a little; simmer briskly for 3-5 minutes, until syrupy. Stir in the lemon juice and remove from the heat. Set aside until ready to serve."}, {"step": "Sift the flour into a bowl. Stir in the salt, almonds, 15g sugar and the grated lemon zest. Rub in the diced butter until the mixture resembles soft sand. Use a blunt knife to quickly mix in 120ml milk, bringing it all together with cool hands once a shaggy dough forms. (Add the extra 10ml milk, if needed, to form a dough that is soft but not sticky.) Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until uniform. Bring together into a disc and roll out to about 4cm thick. Flour a 6-7cm cookie cutter and stamp out 6 rounds, gently reshaping and re-rolling the dough as needed."}, {"step": "Brush the scones with milk, scatter with the remaining 15g caster sugar and swiftly transfer to the hot baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden and risen. Cool on a wire rack, then serve with the clotted cream and compote."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,622kJ 628kcals", "Fat": "35g", "Saturated Fat": "20g", "Carbohydrate": "65g", "Sugars": "27g", "Protein": "8.5g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "6.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/a/Almond-scones-with-compote.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
