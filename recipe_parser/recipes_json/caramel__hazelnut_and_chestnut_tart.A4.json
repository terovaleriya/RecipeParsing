Add the egg yolk and a little cold water and stir with a fork until it forms a rough dough. Gently knead the pastry on a lightly floured surface, then wrap in foil and chill for 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 200Â°C, gas mark 6. Roll out the pastry and line a 23cm loose-bottomed flan tin. Cover with greaseproof paper and fill with baking beans. Cover and rest for 30 minutes in the fridge. Meanwhile, spread the hazelnuts on a tray and roast in the preheated oven for 5 minutes until they are golden. Add to the chestnuts and almonds.  Bake the pastry blind for 15-20 minutes, then remove the weighted paper and bake for a further 5 minutes or until the pastry is just cooked.  Place the sugar, honey, cream and butter in a saucepan. Set over a low heat and stir until the sugar and butter have melted, then boil vigorously for 10-12 minutes until thickened and creamy. Quickly beat and remove from the heat, then immediately stir in the nuts. Pour into the pastry case, return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Serve warm or cold."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/9912fc10r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
