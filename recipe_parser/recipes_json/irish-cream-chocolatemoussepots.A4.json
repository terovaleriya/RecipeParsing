Using electric beaters, whisk the whites until they just reach stiff peaks. Without rinsing the beaters, beat the yolks and sugar until just combined. Use a spatula to stir the yolks into the chocolate until combined. Next, fold in the egg whites in 3 additions, trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible. Pour into glasses or ramekins; chill for at least 4 hours until set."}, {"step": "When ready to serve, put the remaining 100ml double cream and 1 tbsp Irish cream in a mixing bowl and whisk to soft peaks.
