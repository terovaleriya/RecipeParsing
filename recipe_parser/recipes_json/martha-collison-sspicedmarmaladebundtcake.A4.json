Add the eggs to the butter and sugar mixture one at a time, beating after each addition. Add 1 tbsp of the dry mix in between each egg to stop the mixture from curdling."}, {"step": "Add the remaining dry mix and beat until smooth. Place the marmalade into a small bowl and stir until loosened slightly. Spoon the marmalade and orange zest into the batter and mix one final time to combine."}, {"step": "Pour the batter into the prepared tin and bake in the centre of the oven for 40-45 minutes or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool for 10-15 minutes, or until the pan is cool enough to touch. Use a plastic spatula or knife and run it around the edges of the tin if the cake looks like it might be stuck. Invert onto a cooling rack and leave to cool completely before decorating."}, {"step": "Heat the marmalade in a small saucepan with the icing sugar and orange juice and simmer until all the lumps of jelly have melted. Place a sheet of parchment under the cooling rack to catch the drips, and then spoon the glaze over the cake. Use a pastry brush to make sure the entire surface is covered."}, {"step": "Mix the icing sugar with enough orange juice to make a thick icing suitable to pipe. Pour into a piping bag and drizzle over the sticky cake before topping with orange zest and serving."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Martha_Bundt_2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
