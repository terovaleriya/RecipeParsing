Set aside for 30 minutes to rest if you have time."}, {"step": "Heat a heavy 18cm-20cm frying pan over a medium heat. When the pan is thoroughly heated, add 1 tbsp oil, swirl around then tip out any excess. Add enough batter to just coat the base of the pan (40-50ml), swirling it around quickly to make an even layer. Cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the edge begins to curl and the base is golden brown. Use a palette knife to flip the pancake."}, {"step": "Cook for 30-60 seconds more, then transfer to a warm plate. Return the pan to the heat, add a touch more oil, pour out any excess and repeat with the rest of the batter, separating each pancake with a piece of baking paper. The first one or two pancakes are reliably disastrous but the rest should be beautiful. Serve warm with your choice of toppings."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/Baking/pancake-recipe-1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
