Roll out the pastry to line a 25cm loose-based tart tin. Chill for 30 minutes, then line with greaseproof paper, fill with baking beans and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the beans; cook for 10 minutes more until golden.  In a heavy-based pan, heat the caster sugar with 1 tbsp water until dissolved; don't stir. Turn up the heat and boil for 10 minutes, watching it carefully, until it turns a rich amber.  Carefully pour in the double cream, then stir in the muscovado sugar, butter and treacle until combined. Simmer for 10 minutes until thick.  Take off the heat and stir in half the salt. Allow to cool slightly, then pour into the tart case. Cool completely, then chill for 6 hours until set.  Put the granulated sugar and 2 tbsp water in a heavy-based pan on a medium heat. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and bubble until it turns amber. Swirl occasionally so it colours evenly. Add the nuts and cook for 1 minute, stirring, then stir in the remaining salt; scrape onto an oiled baking tray in a layer. Cool.  Crack the praline into shards, scatter over the tart and serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2648.472kJ 633.0kcal", "Fat": "37.0g", "Saturated Fat": "17.5g", "Sugars": "57.0g", "Salt": "0.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/201009ed45r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
