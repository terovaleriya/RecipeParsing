Keeping it on its paper, cut in half lengthways. Starting from one top corner, cut 9 triangles per piece, each measuring 7cm across the top or bottom, and 12cm at the sides (you should have a little pastry left over). Score a border 3mm in from each edge. Brush all edges with egg; chill briefly while you preheat the oven to 200ËšC, gas mark 6."}, {"step": "Discard the paper and transfer the triangles to 2 baking trays lined with baking parchment. Spoon 1 heaped tsp mincemeat into the middle of each triangle, nudging the mincemeat slightly towards the borders. Scatter half of the triangles with the almonds (to make 9 almond trees) and bake all 18 for 10-12 minutes until crisp and golden. Set aside on a wire rack to cool completely."}, {"step": "Mix 75g icing sugar with the lemon juice until smooth. Drizzle or pipe over the almond-free tarts to create 9 snowy trees and mountains.

The tarts will keep in an airtight container for a few days."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per iced tart 652kJ 155kcals", "Fat": "5.6g", "Saturated Fat": "2.8g", "Carbohydrate": "24g", "Sugars": "17g", "Protein": "1.5g", "Salt": "0.06g", "Fibre": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Snowy-mountain-tree-tarts.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
