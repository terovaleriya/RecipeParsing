Alternatively, to check that the oil is hot enough, carefully drop in a cube of bread or potato; if it sizzles and turns golden in 15-30 seconds, the oil is ready. In a large mixing bowl, combine almost all of the salad onions and mint (reserve some of each to serve) with the chilli, ginger, garam masala, turmeric and salt. Mix in the flour and add enough water to make a thick batter (around 125ml-150ml)."}, {"step": "Using a teaspoon, scoop 3-4 large spoonfuls of the batter at a time into the hot oil and fry for 8-10 minutes, until golden all over. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat in batches, using up all the mixture. Add an extra sprinkle of salt and scatter over the remaining salad onions and mint leaves. Serve with mango chutney for dipping."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,405kJ 336kcals", "Fat": "16", "Saturated Fat": "1.2", "Carbohydrate": "42", "Sugars": "12", "Protein": "5", "Salt": "1.4", "Fibre": "2.4"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/salad-onion-pakoras.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
