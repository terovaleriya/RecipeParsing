Wash the potatoes and halve any large ones. Cook in plenty of boiling salted water for about 15 minutes until just tender. Drain thoroughly and return to the pan.  Roughly snip all but 2cm from the chive bundle and put in a food processor with the onions, celery salt, pepper and 2 tbsp of the oil. Blend to a coarse paste.  Tip the mixture over the potatoes and mix well so the potatoes are evenly coated. Tip into a roasting tin and drizzle with the remaining oil. Cook for about 35-40 minutes, turning once or twice until the potatoes are golden. Serve scattered with the remaining chives."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "669.44kJ 160.0kcal", "Fat": "7.4g", "Saturated Fat": "1.1g", "Sugars": "3.1g", "Salt": "1.0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/201004S28r1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
