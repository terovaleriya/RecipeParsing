Add a little milk and start to whisk gently, gradually drawing in the dry ingredients and adding more milk as you whisk to make a smooth, thick batter."}, {"step": "Melt a small knob of butter in a griddle or non-stick frying pan until foaming and drop in 4 to 5 spoonfuls of the batter, leaving enough room for the pancakes to spread. Cook over a medium heat for a couple of minutes until little bubbles rise to the surface of the batter and pop. Turn carefully with a spatula and cook the other side until golden. Keep warm on a covered plate in a low oven while you cook the rest of the batter."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, grill the bacon until crisp. Pile 4 pancakes on a warm plate, top with the bananas and bacon, and serve drizzled with maple syrup."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,233kJ 531kcals", "Fat": "17.9g", "Saturated Fat": "6.5g", "Carbohydrate": "72.7g", "Sugars": "29g", "Protein": "19.7g", "Salt": "2.5g", "Fibre": "2.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/Waitrose-Weekend_Wk302_WKEND-Menu_Sat-Brunch_Banana-Maple-Pancakes-Crispy-Bacon.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
