Stir the cheese into the cooled vegetable mixture and season to taste.  Dust the work surface with flour and roll out the pastry a little thinner than a £1 coin.  Using a 12cm plain round cutter or small bowl, cut out 8 discs.  Divide the filling between them, placing it into the centre of each one.  Mix together the egg yolks and milk to make a glaze, then brush the edges of the pastry. Fold the pastry over the filling, pinch and crimp to seal then place on a non-stick baking sheet.  Glaze the tops then chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C, gas mark 4.  Bake the pasties for 35-40 minutes until golden then transfer to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes before serving."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,626kj 390kcals", "Fat": "26.8g", "Saturated Fat": "15.4g", "Carbohydrate": "28.2g", "Sugars": "2.3g", "Protein": "9.1g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "1.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/v/Veg_taleggio_Pasties2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
