Beat the egg with 1 tbsp cold water, add to the pastry and pulse or use a cutlery knife to combine. Add ½ tbsp water if needed to bring the mixture together. Roll out on a lightly floured surface to the thickness of a £1 coin. Use the pastry to line a 25cm fluted, loose-based tart tin, trimming off any excess pastry. Prick the base with a fork; chill for an hour. Preheat the oven to 200˚C, gas mark 6. Line the pastry with crumpled baking parchment. Fill with baking beans and bake for 20 minutes."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, to make the frangipane, use electric beaters to beat together the butter and caster sugar. Add the eggs, a little at a time. Fold in the flour, a pinch of salt, the almonds and extract. Carefully remove the parchment and baking beans from the pastry case and reduce the oven temperature to 180˚C, gas mark 4. Let the pastry case stand for a few minutes before spreading the frangipane over the base, then scatter the blueberries on top. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until the frangipane is golden and cooked through. Cool on a wire rack."}, {"step": "Once cool, combine the icing sugar with ¾-1 tbsp water; mix until smooth. Drizzle over the tart then slice to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,656kJ 397kcals", "Fat": "23g", "Saturated Fat": "12g", "Carbohydrate": "39g", "Sugars": "21g", "Protein": "6.8g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "1.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/250620_Waitrose_Baking_Blueberry-Frangipane-V2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
