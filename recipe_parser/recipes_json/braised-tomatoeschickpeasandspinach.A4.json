Add the garlic, shallots and a pinch of salt; sauté for 10 minutes. Add the chilli and cumin, stir for a few minutes, then add the tomato purée. Cook for a couple more minutes, then add the chickpeas with their liquid, the olives and 100ml water. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes."}, {"step": "Cut the tomatoes into rough wedges, then add to the pan so they sit in one layer on top. Scatter over the spinach and cook over a medium-high heat for a further 10 minutes.
