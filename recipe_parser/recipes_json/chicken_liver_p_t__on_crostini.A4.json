Leave to cool for 5 minutes, then discard the rosemary.  Place the warm livers in a food processor and blend until smooth. With the motor running, pour in the cream, followed by the wine, and process until well blended and completely smooth. Season to taste, then spoon into a shallow serving dish or 4 x 100ml ramekins. Cover and leave in the fridge for about 1 hour until firmly set.  To make the crostini, brush a little olive oil over both sides of each slice of bread and place under a hot grill, lightly toasting each side for 1-2 minutes.  To make the canapés, spread the pâté on the crostini and top with a selection of garnishes, such as sliced sunblush tomatoes, sliced black olives or a sprig of flat-leaf parsley. Alternatively, serve the pâté in its dish or ramekins. You can make the pâté a couple of days in advance. Cover and keep chilled in the fridge."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2309.568kJ 552.0kcal", "Fat": "35.1g", "Saturated Fat": "17.1g", "Sugars": "3.1g", "Salt": "1.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/0612r05.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
