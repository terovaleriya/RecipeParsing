Add the egg and beat vigorously with a wooden spoon to create a thick, lump-free batter. Gradually stir in the buttermilk. Cut the pears into hazelnut-sized pieces; stir into the batter.  Preheat the oven to 110°C/gas ¼ and heat a large frying pan over a medium heat. Dip a scrunched-up piece of kitchen paper into the vegetable oil and use to wipe over the pan. Drop 3 large tablespoonfuls of batter into the pan, to make 3 separate pancakes. Cook for 2–3 minutes until the bases are firm and bubbles begin to appear on the surface. Flip them over using a spatula and cook for 2 minutes, until golden. Keep warm in the oven while you cook the remaining batter in the same way.  Drizzle with the maple syrup and scatter with the pecans before serving."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "652.704kJ 156.0kcal", "Fat": "5.7g", "Saturated Fat": "0.7g", "Sugars": "13.6g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0802026-r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
