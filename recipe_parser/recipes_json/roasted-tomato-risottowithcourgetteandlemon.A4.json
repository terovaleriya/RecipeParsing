Put the classic vine tomatoes in a roasting tin with the courgettes. Toss with 2 tsp oil, season and roast for 15 minutes. Toss through the cherry tomatoes, return to the oven for 15 minutes, then set aside."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tsp oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan. Add the onion, celery, carrot and garlic; season and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened. Turn up the heat a little, add the rice and wine, then cook for 2 minutes until the wine has almost evaporated."}, {"step": "Take the larger roasted tomatoes out of the tin and blend with the stock until smooth. Tip into a separate pan and keep warm over a low heat. Stir 2 ladles of the warm stock mixture into the rice, then reduce the heat and simmer until most of the liquid has been absorbed. Stir in another 2 ladles until almost absorbed. Continue to cook in this way for 20 minutes, until the rice is al dente and the risotto has a loose consistency (add a little extra stock mixture or warm water if needed)."}, {"step": "Take the pan off the heat and stir through the cherry tomatoes, courgettes, basil, lemon zest and juice, and most of the parmesan; season.
