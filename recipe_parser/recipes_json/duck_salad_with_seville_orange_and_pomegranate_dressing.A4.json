Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour, or leave overnight in the fridge.  Cut the pomegranate in half. Squeeze one  half into a jug to collect the juice, then bash  out the seeds from the other half and set aside. Peel the sweet oranges and slice the flesh into rounds. Bring the water in your steamer to  the boil. Remove the duck breasts from the marinade and season. Steam, covered, over  a medium heat for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, for the dressing, whisk the remaining Seville orange zest and juice, the walnut oil and olive oil into the pomegranate juice. Season the dressing and toss with the chicory leaves in a bowl. To serve, divide the dressed chicory between 4 plates and slice the duck. Arrange the duck on the chicory with  the orange slices and pomegranate seeds."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1322.144kJ 316.0kcal", "Fat": "14.2g", "Saturated Fat": "2.2g", "Sugars": "14.8g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/d/0801032-r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
