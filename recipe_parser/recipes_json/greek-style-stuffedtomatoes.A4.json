Put the rice in a pan, cover with water, bring to the boil over a medium-high heat and simmer for 18 minutes, then drain. Meanwhile, cut the tops off the tomatoes, then use a teaspoon to scoop out the insides into a jug, leaving the shells intact. Arrange the shells in a small/medium baking dish in which they sit snugly."}, {"step": "Fry the onion in 2 tbsp oil in a pan over a low-medium heat, stirring, for 5 minutes. Add the courgettes, turn the heat up slightly and cook for 5 minutes more. Add the garlic and tomato purée, cook for a minute, then stir in the reserved tomato pulp and the par-cooked rice.
