Squeeze the sausages out of their skins, cut each one into 5-6 small nuggets, then roll into small oblong balls with wet hands.  Add the sausage balls to the hot oil. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring carefully throughout, until golden all over.  Add the onion and bacon and mix in well, scraping up any cooked bits of sausage meat from the base of the pan. Cook for a further 5 minutes, until the onion starts to soften.  Mix in the tomato purée, beans and the tomatoes, adding a dash of water if needed. Mix well and cook for 3-5 minutes until piping hot.  Spoon into shallow bowls and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve with plenty of crusty bread and dressed green salad."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1481.136kJ 354.0kcal", "Fat": "20.9g", "Saturated Fat": "7.0g", "Sugars": "8.0g", "Salt": "1.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/q/0308sps24-r04.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
