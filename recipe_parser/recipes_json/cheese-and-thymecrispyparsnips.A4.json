Combine the cheese, polenta and thyme leaves, season and spread out on a large, flat plate. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Halve or quarter the parsnips lengthways (ensuring they are evenly sized). Boil for 4 minutes, then drain."}, {"step": "Put the hot parsnips onto the plate of cheese and roll them around until most of the mixture has stuck to them. Don’t worry if there is a lot of loose mixture. Pour the oil into a roasting tin and put in the oven for 5 minutes until very hot. Carefully tip in the parsnips and scatter any remaining cheese mixture over the top. Roast for 30-40 minutes, turning halfway through, until crisp and deep golden. Serve immediately with some aioli to dip into, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (6) 1344kJ 323kcals", "Fat": "20g", "Saturated Fat": "5.5g", "Carbohydrate": "22g", "Sugars": "9.3g", "Protein": "9.2g", "Salt": "0.4g", "Fibre": "8.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/Cheese-and-thyme-parsnips.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
