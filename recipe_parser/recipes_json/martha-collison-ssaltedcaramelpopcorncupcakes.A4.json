Use an electric whisk to cream together the butter and brown sugar until pale and fluffy (for about 4-5 minutes). Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the golden syrup."}, {"step": "In a separate bowl, combine the flour and baking powder. Add this gradually into the butter and egg mixture until a thick batter forms. Finally, stir in the milk and popcorn."}, {"step": "Divide the mixture between the muffin cases and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cakes are risen, golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before decorating."}, {"step": "To make the icing, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Once melted, stir in the brown sugar and double cream and simmer over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes until smooth and bubbling. Remove from the heat and sieve over the icing sugar. Beat the sugar and salt in using a wooden spoon until the icing is thick and holds its shape."}, {"step": "Spoon a dollop of icing onto the top of each cupcake and use a palette knife to spread it out to the edges. Top each cake with a few pieces of popcorn to finish. These cupcakes will keep for 3-4 days in the fridge."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,589kJ 387kcals", "Fat": "15g", "Saturated Fat": "9.3g", "Carbohydrate": "56g", "Sugars": "44g", "Protein": "3.1g", "Salt": "0.5g", "Fibre": "0.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/WRWK18082016-Martha-popcorn-cupcakes.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
