Put the squash in a roasting tin, sprinkle over the cinnamon, cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes, until soft. Set aside to cool. Roast the nuts on a tray for 4-6 minutes, until a shade darker. Remove, leave to cool, then chop."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, in a large bowl combine the oats, milk, vanilla, maple syrup or honey plus a pinch of salt. Once the squash is cool, mash with a fork (or whizz in a food processor) until smooth.

If you prefer it thinner, then add a few tablespoons of milk. Divide the oats between 4 bowls (or jars, to transport) then top with the yogurt, pecans and a drizzle of maple syrup or honey."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,499kJ 358kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "3.1g", "Carbohydrate": "44g", "Sugars": "16g", "Protein": "12g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "6.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/o/Overnight-oats-with-squash.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
