Pour in the hot lamb stock and bring to the boil. Skim off and discard any scum that comes to the surface.  Once boiling, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for  3 hours, stirring occasionally – making sure that the mixture doesn’t catch on the base of the pan – until the vegetables are cooked and the chunks of lamb very tender. Serve sprinkled with chopped fresh thyme, and hunks of crusty white bread."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2426.72kJ 580.0kcal", "Fat": "23.9g", "Saturated Fat": "10.9g", "Sugars": "15.0g", "Salt": "2.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/e/0901ws25-r3.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
