Divide the dough into 12 even-sized pieces. Dust the work surface with flour and roll each piece into a 15cm circle. Layer these flatbreads between sheets of greaseproof paper. When ready to cook place directly on the hot griddle, with no oil, and cook for about 2-3 minutes, turning once, until the bread puffs up slightly and has charred griddle marks. Keep warm while you cook the rest."}, {"step": "Thread the marinated chicken onto 8 short metal skewers (4 pieces per skewer). Return the griddle to a medium heat. Cook the kebabs, in batches if necessary, for 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally until golden and charred in parts, and cooked throughout, with the juices running clear and no pink meat. Serve with the wraps and salad in serving bowls or dishes and place on the table for everyone to help themselves."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,928kJ 698kcals", "Fat": "29g", "Saturated Fat": "8.6g", "Carbohydrate": "57g", "Sugars": "9g", "Protein": "48g", "Salt": "2.6g", "Fibre": "6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/o/Oregano-wraps-2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
