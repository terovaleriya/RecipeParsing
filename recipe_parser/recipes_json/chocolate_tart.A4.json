Make the pastry using our step by step guide, adding the cocoa with the flour. Roll into a disc as thick as a £1 coin and big enough to fit a 25cm fluted tin. Drape the pastry over the rolling pin, lay over the tin and push into the base, leaving any excess hanging over the edge. Chill for 10 minutes."}, {"step": "Blind-bake the pastry: cut a piece of greaseproof paper a bit larger than the tin. Scrunch it up, open it out and push it into the pastry base.

Remove from the oven, cool for 10 minutes, then trim off the excess pastry."}, {"step": "Turn down the oven to 140°C, gas mark 1. For the filling, place the chocolate in a large bowl.
