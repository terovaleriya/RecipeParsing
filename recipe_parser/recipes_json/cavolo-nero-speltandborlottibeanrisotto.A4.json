Put the oil in a medium saucepan, then set over a low-medium heat. Add the onion with a little salt; cook gently for 7 minutes, stirring, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute, then stir in the spelt. Turn the heat up slightly and add the wine, stirring until it has almost evaporated. Add the stock and cover.
