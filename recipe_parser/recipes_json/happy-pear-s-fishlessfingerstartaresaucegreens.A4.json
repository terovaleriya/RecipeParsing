Drain the cashews, then pulse with the tofu, chick peas, garlic granules, seaweed and ½ tsp salt in a food processor until smooth but still with a little texture. Shape into 10 fingers (about 50g each), or 12 smaller ones, and set aside."}, {"step": "Using a fork, mix the flaxseed with 180ml cold water to make ‘flax egg’. Set aside to thicken.

Heat a nonstick frying pan over a high heat. Add 2 tbsp of sunflower or vegetable oil, reduce to a medium heat and cook the fingers in batches for 5-6 minutes until golden, turning occasionally. Add more oil as needed. Set aside on kitchen paper and keep warm. Return the pan to the heat, add the spinach, olive oil and a pinch of salt. Leave to wilt for 2-3 minutes. Serve immediately with the fishless fingers and tartare sauce."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,967kJ 716kcal", "Fat": "55g", "Saturated Fat": "6.7g", "Carbohydrate": "30g", "Sugars": "3.5g", "Protein": "20g", "Salt": "3.3g", "Fibre": "10g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/h/Happy Pear's fishless fingers, tartare sauce & greens.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
