Add the chicken and stir well. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 1-2 hours or overnight.  Preheat the grill to high. Thread the chicken, salad onions and pepper pieces alternately, dividing them between 4 metal skewers, reserving the marinade.  Place the kebabs on the grill rack and brush liberally with the marinade. Cook for 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with the marinade. The chicken should be cooked until the juices run clear and there is no pink meat; the vegetables should be lightly charred. Serve immediately, with Waitrose Medium Egg Noodles, garnished with salad onions."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "803.328kJ 192.0kcal", "Fat": "3.2g", "Saturated Fat": "0.9g", "Sugars": "8.3g", "Salt": "2.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/y/0603r09.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
