Grease and line a  27 x 18cm shallow baking tin with baking parchment. Cut the fudge roughly into 1cm cubes.  Put the chocolate and butter in a bowl and melt, either using the microwave on medium power for 2-3 minutes or by resting the bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Stir to make a smooth sauce.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until thick, smooth and beginning to froth. Stir in the slightly cooled melted chocolate mixture, then the flour and baking powder.  Lightly stir in half the fudge and nuts and turn into the tin, spreading into the corners. Scatter with remaining fudge and nuts. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes until a sugary crust has formed but the mixture feels wobbly underneath. (Check the brownies frequently towards the end of cooking as the flavour and texture are better if moist and gooey. Don’t forget that both the chocolate and butter will firm up as the cake cools.) Leave to cool completely in the tin.  Lift out of the tin and cut into 24 small squares."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "937.216kJ 224.0kcal", "Fat": "13.1g", "Saturated Fat": "7.0g", "Sugars": "22.6g", "Salt": "0.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/228_p14_sea-salt-brownies-pic_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
