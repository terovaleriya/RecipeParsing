Stir in the garlic, saffron and paprika and cook for 2-3 minutes then add the chopped tomatoes. Gently simmer for 8-10 minutes until the tomatoes have softened. Stir in the rice, coating well with the spice and tomato mix.  Add the white wine and allow to bubble and reduce by about half before adding all the fish stock. Simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until almost all of the stock has been absorbed. Stir regularly.  Add the monkfish and leave on a gentle heat for 5 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and opaque. Stir in the prawns and cook for a minute only to heat through. Stir in the parsley, season and serve immediately, with a crisp salad."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2083.632kJ 498.0kcal", "Fat": "7.0g", "Saturated Fat": "1.0g", "Salt": "0.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0507ss04-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
