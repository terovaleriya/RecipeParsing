Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the water. Using a spatula, bring the mixture together very roughly then tip out onto a surface."}, {"step": "Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elasticated, trying not to add too much flour. Shape the dough into a ball and place into an oiled bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and place somewhere warm for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 220ºC, gas mark 7 or higher if the oven allows.

Transfer to lightly oiled pizza trays or baking sheets."}, {"step": "Spoon a thin layer of passata over each pizza base, then scatter over your choice of toppings, taking care not to overload it. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.
