Melt the chocolate over a bain marie or in the microwave until smooth. Carefully separate the vermicelli and stir through the chocolate using a spoon or your hands until completely coated.

Make an indent in the centre of each one, then place into the fridge to set."}, {"step": "To make the buttercream, use an electric hand whisk to cream the butter and icing sugar together. When combined, add the milk and whisk again until smooth and light.
