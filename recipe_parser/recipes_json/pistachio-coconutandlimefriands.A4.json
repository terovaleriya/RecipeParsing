Cut 12 circles of baking parchment ready to line the holes of a 12-hole muffin tin. Grease the holes with some melted coconut oil, dust over some flour then shake out any excess, ensuring the sides are well coated. Sit a parchment circle in each hole."}, {"step": "Whisk the aquafaba until it just forms soft peaks – about 3 minutes. Tip in the 185g sugar then whisk for another 30 seconds (be careful not to whisk too much, as it will cause the cakes to sink when they cook). Fold in the flour, baking powder, salt, pistachios and lime zest, then gently stir in the coconut oil. Carefully spoon the mixture into the prepared muffin tray."}, {"step": "Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until risen a little in the middle, light golden and springy to the touch. Scoop out of the tin and onto a wire rack to cool. In a small pan, mix 3 tbsp lime juice with the 3 tbsp sugar then simmer gently for 3-5 minutes until sticky and thickened. Brush the cakes with the syrup and sprinkle with the extra pistachios."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per friand 847kJ 203kcals", "Fat": "11g", "Saturated Fat": "8.3g", "Carbohydrate": "22g", "Sugars": "11g", "Protein": "2.2g", "Salt": "0.3g", "Fibre": "0.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/Pistachio-friands.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
