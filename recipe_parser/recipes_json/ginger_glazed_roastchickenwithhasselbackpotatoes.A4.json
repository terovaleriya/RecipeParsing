Place in a small roasting tin, pour over 150ml water and roast in the oven for 15 minutes.

Check that the chicken is cooked through (with no pink meat) then carve the chicken and serve with the potatoes and the juices from the chicken spooned over."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2589.896kJ 619kcals", "Fat": "38.2g", "Saturated Fat": "10.7g", "Carbohydrate": "30.2g", "Sugars": "7.5g", "Salt": "0.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/g/201205Wked13r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
