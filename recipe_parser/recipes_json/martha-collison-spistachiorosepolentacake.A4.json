Tip into a small bowl and add the ground almonds, polenta and baking powder."}, {"step": "Cream together the butter and sugar using an electric hand whisk until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition. Stir in the dry ingredients and beat until smooth. Scrape the batter into the prepared tin and level the surface. Bake for 45-50 minutes until risen and firm. Test the cake using a skewer – it should come out clean when inserted into the centre. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack. The cake may sink slightly in the centre, but this is normal for polenta cakes."}, {"step": "While the cake is baking, make the crystallised pistachios. Place the sugar and 50ml of cold water into a small saucepan and bring to the boil. When the sugar syrup reaches 135°C on a sugar thermometer and it just starts to colour around the edges, remove from the heat and tip in the pistachios. Beat rapidly with a balloon whisk so the syrup crystallises around the pistachios, then tip onto a sheet of baking parchment to cool completely. When cool enough to handle, pull apart to separate the nuts."}, {"step": "To make the icing, combine the icing sugar and rose water in a small bowl with just enough water to make a thick icing. Drizzle all over the cooled cake, then roughly chop the crystallised pistachios and sprinkle over the top with a few rose petals before serving."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,203kJ 528kcals", "Fat": "34.4g", "Saturated Fat": "13.8g", "Carbohydrate": "46.8g", "Sugars": "38.1g", "Protein": "7.9g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "2.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/WRWK130417-Martha-pistachio-rose-cake.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
