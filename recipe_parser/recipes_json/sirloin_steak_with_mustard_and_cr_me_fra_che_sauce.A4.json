Season the steaks then cook in the pan for 2-3 minutes on each side (for rare), 4 minutes on each side (for medium) or 6 minutes on each side (for well done). Place the steaks on a plate and cover with foil to keep warm for 5 minutes.  Add the chopped shallot to the pan and cook for 1 minute until softened. Add the wine and let it bubble, scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook for 30 seconds, or until reduced to about a tablespoon of liquid. Add the crème fraîche and mustard, season to taste and stir in the parsley.  Place the steaks on 2 warmed plates and pour the sauce over. Serve with new potatoes and stir-fried curly kale with chestnuts (see Cook's tip)."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1840.96kJ 440.0kcal", "Fat": "26.4g", "Saturated Fat": "11.7g", "Sugars": "3.1g", "Salt": "0.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0710r06.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
