Add the aubergine with the oregano and a pinch of salt. Cook for 5–6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden. Lower the heat and add the onion. Cook for a few minutes, until starting to soften, then add the garlic and parsley stalks and cook for 1 minute. Add the capers, olives and vinegar. Cook for a couple of minutes, until the vinegar has evaporated, then add the tomatoes and cannellini beans. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes, or until all the vegetables are tender. Season and add more vinegar to taste. You can enjoy this straight away, or let it sit a while to allow the flavours to develop before serving at room temperature. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil, if liked, and scatter over the pine nuts and chopped parsley leaves."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,094kj 262kcal", "Fat": "15.7g", "Saturated Fat": "21.2g", "Carbohydrate": "21.7g", "Sugars": "12.1g", "Protein": "8.5g", "Salt": "1.4g", "Fibre": "9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/a/Aubergine caponata.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
