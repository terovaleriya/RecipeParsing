Grease and line a 23x30cm rectangular baking tin with non-stick baking parchment. In a large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar with an electric hand whisk until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and tip in a little ofthe flour after each addition. Using a large metal spoon, fold in the remaining flour until just combined. Add enough of the milk so the mixture drops off the end of a spoon when tapped."}, {"step": "Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake tin and level the top with the back of a spoon — make it slightly hollow in the middle. Bake in the centre of the oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely."}, {"step": "To assemble the cakes, use a 5cm round pastry cutter to cut out 20 discs from the sponge. Sandwich together 2 discs with a spoonful of the strawberry conserve and a spoonful of whipped cream. Repeat with all of the sponges. Best eaten on the day they are baked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1669.416kJ 399kcals", "Fat": "23.8g", "Saturated Fat": "14.6g", "Carbohydrate": "42.1g", "Sugars": "28.3g", "Salt": "0.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/17_TeaPartyHero_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
