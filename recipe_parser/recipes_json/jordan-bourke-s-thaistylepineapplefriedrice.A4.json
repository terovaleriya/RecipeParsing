Meanwhile, prepare all the ingredients, as this dish cooks very quickly. Put 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large non-stick pan set over a high heat. Season the pineapple. Once the pan is hot, add the pineapple and fry for 6-7 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden on each side. Remove and set aside."}, {"step": "Put the pan back over a high heat with the remaining 2½ tbsp vegetable oil. Once very hot, add the beaten eggs and onion and immediately stir for 30 seconds until just cooked and scrambled. Add the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, lime juice and most of the chillies and stir-fry for another minute."}, {"step": "Add the cooked rice and toss together, then spread the rice out over the base of the pan. Fry for 1 minute, then toss together. Repeat this process 3-4 more times until the rice begins to crisp up. Add the Thai basil, cashew nuts, pineapple and remaining chilli, then toss together. Season, without adding any more soy sauce as you want to keep the rice as dry as possible. Serve straight away on a large plate."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (4) 2195kJ 523kcals", "Fat": "21g", "Saturated Fat": "2.9g", "Carbohydrate": "67g", "Sugars": "12g", "Protein": "13g", "Salt": "1.4g", "Fibre": "3.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/t/Thai-style-pineapple-rice.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
