Roughly chop the sage and rosemary then, using a pestle and mortar, grind with the garlic, lemon zest and juice, and seasoning to make a thick paste. Cut the string off the pork and unroll the meat so that it is flat. With a sharp knife, make incisions into the flesh before rubbing the paste into the incisions and over the flesh, taking care to avoid the skin. Transfer to a roasting tray and, ideally, sit it on a rack. Using a piece of kitchen paper, thoroughly dry the skin and season with a little salt – this is optional, but helps make crisper crackling. Roast for 20 minutes then reduce the oven to 170°C, gas mark 3 for a further 2 hours until the pork is thoroughly cooked and the juices run clear. Leave to rest for 5 minutes then cut into chunks, and serve with steamed purple-sprouting broccoli and apple sauce."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,655kj 639kcals", "Fat": "48.5g", "Saturated Fat": "16.8g", "Carbohydrate": "2.2g", "Sugars": "0.4g", "Protein": "48.4g", "Salt": "0.4g", "Fibre": "0.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0901ws25-r5.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
