In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients apart from the oil, and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Whisk in enough olive oil to cover the ingredients, season and set aside at room temperature until ready to serve."}, {"step": "For the peppers, lightly coat them in the oil. Place directly onto the hottest part of the barbecue and cook, turning, until the skins are blackened. Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling film and leave to cool. Peel and discard the charred skin and seeds from the peppers, then slice and mix with the chopped garlic and parsley; season."}, {"step": "Take the meat out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to cook, to bring it to room temperature. Place on the medium-low part of the barbecue and season generously. Cook for about 20-25 minutes on  each side, until well coloured, tender and medium-rare; rest under foil for 20 minutes. Slice the steak and serve  on a large platter with the grilled peppers and plenty of chimichurri."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,943kJ 466kcal", "Fat": "30.4g", "Saturated Fat": "6.9g", "Carbohydrate": "6.3g", "Sugars": "4.5g", "Protein": "41.8g", "Salt": "0.3g", "Fibre": "1.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Skirt-steak.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
