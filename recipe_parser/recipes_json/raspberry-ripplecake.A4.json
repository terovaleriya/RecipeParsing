Sieve the flour and baking powder over the top and then fold in. The mixture will be quite runny."}, {"step": "Crush the raspberries to a paste with a fork. Pour the cake mixture into the lined tin and gently ripple half the crushed raspberries through the batter. Bake for 50-60 minutes or until risen, golden brown and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool completely."}, {"step": "Whip the cream with the icing sugar into soft peaks and swirl through the remaining crushed raspberries. Pile over the cooled cake and top with fresh (if using) and freeze-dried raspberries before serving. This cake will keep refrigerated for 2-3 days, but is best served straightaway."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,733kJ 415kcal", "Fat": "23g", "Saturated Fat": "13g", "Carbohydrate": "45g", "Sugars": "29g", "Protein": "6.1g", "Salt": "0.5g", "Fibre": "3.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Martha's raspberry ripple cake.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
