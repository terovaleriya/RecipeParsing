Sprinkle over the sherry vinegar. Add the chopped tomatoes and cucumber, along with the chilli and sundried tomato paste, and whizz until smooth – you may have to do this in 2 batches. Add 300ml cold water and blitz again – you can adjust the amount to make the soup thicker or thinner to suit your taste. Season, then cover and chill. Ladle into bowls, drizzle a tablespoon of sour cream over each, then top with olives, chopped cucumber (if using) and chives, and serve with breadsticks."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "552.288kJ 132.0kcal", "Fat": "4.8g", "Saturated Fat": "1.2g", "Sugars": "8.2g", "Salt": "1.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/f/0707SS17-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
