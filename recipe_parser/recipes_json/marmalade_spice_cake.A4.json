Stir in half the marmalade."}, {"step": "Sift the flour with the baking powder and spices and fold half into the creamed ingredients. Stir in 150ml of the milk, then the remaining flour mixture to give a stiff, creamed consistency. Spoon into the prepared tin and smooth the surface. Bake for 55-60 minutes until golden and well risen. A skewer should emerge dry from the middle of the cake. Turn onto a wire rack and leave to cool, base-side up."}, {"step": "When the cake is cool, heat the remaining marmalade in a small pan until warmed through then spread over the cake.
