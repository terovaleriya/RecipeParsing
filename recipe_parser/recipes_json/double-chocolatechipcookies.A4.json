Add the egg and vanilla; beat until combined. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and cocoa with a generous pinch of salt. Fold this into the butter mixture with the white chocolate; mix until combined into a stiff dough. Cover the bowl and chill for at least 30 minutes (ideally 1 hour)."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 200˚C, gas mark 6. Line 2 trays with baking parchment. Take half the dough out of the fridge. Scoop slightly heaped tablespoons and roll into balls. Sit on the tray and flatten a little; bake one tray at a time for 10 minutes until cracks start to form. Cool on the tray until slightly firmed up; transfer to a wire rack. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough and serve either warm or cooled."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "842kJ 201kcals", "Fat": "9.6g", "Saturated Fat": "5.8g", "Carbohydrate": "26g", "Sugars": "17g", "Protein": "2.7g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "0.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/d/250620_Waitrose_Baking_Chocolate-Chip-Cookies_V3_EXT.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
