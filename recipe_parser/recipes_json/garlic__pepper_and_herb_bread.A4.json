Mix to a dough with a round-bladed knife. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes (or use a mixer with a dough hook). Place in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave to rise in a warm place for about 45 minutes, until doubled in size.  Tip out onto a floured surface and divide the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each to a naan-shaped oval, measuring about 22cm in length. Cover loosely with a tea towel and leave to stand for 10 minutes.  Melt the butter in a small pan with the olive oil and stir in the garlic. Lay half the dough pieces over the hot coals and brush with a little of the garlic butter. Cook for 1½ -2 minutes until the underside is golden. Flip over the bread and cook until golden. Scatter with sea salt and stack up on a plate while cooking the remainder in the same way."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1050.184kJ 251.0kcal", "Fat": "11.0g", "Saturated Fat": "5.5g", "Sugars": "1.0g", "Salt": "1.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/g/0909ss16r1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
