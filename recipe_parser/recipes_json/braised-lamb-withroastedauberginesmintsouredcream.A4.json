Place the aubergine slices in a small roasting tin in a single layer and drizzle with a tablespoon of the oil. Season then roast in the oven for 45-50 minutes until charred and golden."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, heat some of the remaining oil in a flameproof casserole and brown the lamb on all sides. Remove with a slotted spoon. Add a splash of the white wine to the pan and scrape away all the brown bits on the base of the pan. Add the remaining oil, onion and garlic to the pan and cook for 5 minutes until soft and golden.

Stir the soured cream and chopped mint together then stir into the lamb but don’t mix in completely – you want a marbled effect. Check the seasoning and serve with jacket potatoes or bread to mop up the juices."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,788kJ 430kcal", "Fat": "29g", "Saturated Fat": "12g", "Carbohydrate": "8.8g", "Sugars": "7.6g", "Protein": "27g", "Salt": "0.3g", "Fibre": "3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/Braised lamb with roasted aubergines, mint & soured cream.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
