When it melts add the salad onions and cook for 3 minutes, until softened, then add half the Serrano ham. Turn the heat down and gradually add the flour, stirring throughout, for 5 minutes. Slowly stir in the hot milk, and cook for 5 minutes further, stirring constantly, until really thick and the sauce leaves the side of the pan when you stir it. Add the remaining Serrano ham. Season."}, {"step": "Stir in the grated Manchego, then transfer the mixture to a bowl and allow to cool totally, covering the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming. Place in the fridge and allow to chill for about 2 hours."}, {"step": "When ready to cook put the beaten eggs in one shallow bowl and the breadcrumbs in another. Shape the mixture into 20 bullet-like cylinders. Roll the croquettas in the egg first and then in the breadcrumbs until well coated."}, {"step": "Heat the vegetable oil in a large heavy-based saucepan to 180Â°C, or until a cube of bread crisps and turns golden in about 30 seconds.

Lift out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper before serving as part of a tapas platter with olives, marinated peppers and artichokes, griddled sourdough and semi-dried tomatoes."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,501kJ 360kcals", "Fat": "23.9g", "Saturated Fat": "10.5g", "Carbohydrate": "21.5g", "Sugars": "3.8g", "Protein": "14.8g", "Salt": "1.2g", "Fibre": "0.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Serrano-Ham-&-Cheese-Croquettes_166441.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
