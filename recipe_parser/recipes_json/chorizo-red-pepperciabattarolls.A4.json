Meanwhile, set a large griddle over a medium-high heat (or prepare the barbecue to a medium heat). Slice down and around the peppers to cut off the ‘cheeks’ (leaving just the stalk and a little pepper at the base which can be saved for salads). Toss with the oil and garlic, season and griddle for 5 minutes on each side."}, {"step": "Taking care not to slice completely through the skin, cut lengthways through the chorizo sausages. Flatten with the base of your hand and cook on the griddle or barbecue for 5-6 minutes on each side.
