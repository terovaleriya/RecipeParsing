Line the base of a 20cm solid-bottomed deep pie or cake tin with baking parchment. Halve each sheet of filo to make 2 squares, then stack the squares on the work surface. Brush the top sheet with melted butter and fold it over itself into thirds so you end up with a rectangle made up of 3 layers of buttered pastry."}, {"step": "Spread this pastry strip with 1 tbsp mincemeat and fold it in half lengthways, with the open side furthest away from you. Gather and fold this mincemeat sandwich into a concertina of pleats or ruffles and arrange in the prepared tin with the sealed side of the sandwich on the bottom of the tin (open pleats uppermost)."}, {"step": "Repeat until you have buttered, folded, filled and pleated each sheet, and placed them tightly next to each other in the tin, to create a complete layer. Brush the top of the pastry ruffles with a little more melted butter, put the tin on a baking tray and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 20 minutes, until crisp and golden. Reduce the oven temperature to 150˚C, gas mark 2."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, make the custard. In a small pan, heat the milk, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and citrus zest over a low heat until just before boiling point. Take off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes. Whisk the eggs, yolk, caster sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Pour the infused milk over the egg mixture and whisk until smooth."}, {"step": "Strain the custard mixture into the tin over the crisp filo ruffles. The ruffles should peek out above the custard. Return the pie to the oven for 20 minutes. Scatter over the almonds, pistachios and candied peel, then bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the custard is golden and set. Cool to room temperature, run a knife around the outside to loosen, lift onto a serving plate and dust with icing sugar to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,943kJ 462kcals", "Fat": "17g", "Saturated Fat": "6.3g", "Carbohydrate": "67g", "Sugars": "48g", "Protein": "9.4g", "Salt": "0.5g", "Fibre": "2.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/Ruffled-filo-mincemeat-pie.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
