Rub the soft butter through the dry mix until it resembles breadcrumbs. Toss the rhubarb in 1 tbsp flour.  Lightly grease a 12–hole muffin tin. Preheat the oven to 180˚C/gas 4.  Sift 225g flour, the baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt into a mixing bowl. Add the caster sugar; stir to mix. Whisk the buttermilk, melted butter, vanilla and eggs; add to the dry mix; stir quickly until just combined.  Divide the batter between the muffin holes. Top each with the rhubarb, then with the crumble mix. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Allow to cool for 5 minutes; put on a wire rack."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1292.856kJ 309.0kcal", "Fat": "14.0g", "Saturated Fat": "8.0g", "Sugars": "20.0g", "Salt": "0.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/0909wfi26r1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
