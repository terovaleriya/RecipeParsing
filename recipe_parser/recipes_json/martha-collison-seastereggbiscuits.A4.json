Beat in the vanilla paste (if using) and the lime zest and juice."}, {"step": "Mix together the flour, cornflour and a pinch of salt in a separate bowl. Gradually work into the butter to form a stiff dough; if it’s too crumbly, add more lime juice."}, {"step": "Roll the dough into a log shape about 6cm in diameter and wrap tightly in cling film. Gently press one long edge of the log on the work surface, to a rounded point, smoothing it to create an egg-shaped cross-section. Chill for at least 1 hour."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 180˚C, gas mark 4. Using a sharp knife, trim the ends from the dough, then slice into 0.5cm-thick biscuits. Spread over a few parchment-lined trays and bake, switching the trays halfway if needed, until just starting to colour – about 12-15 minutes. Leave to cool on a wire rack."}, {"step": "Melt the chocolate in a bain-marie or microwave, then pour into a disposable piping bag. Leave to cool and thicken for 10 minutes, then cut a small opening and pipe decorations – try stripes, zigzags and spots – onto your Easter cookies."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "699kJ 167kcals", "Fat": "9.8g", "Saturated Fat": "6.3g", "Carbohydrate": "18.1g", "Sugars": "5.3g", "Protein": "1.7g", "Salt": "trace", "Fibre": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Waitrose-Kitchen-12-01-157022_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
