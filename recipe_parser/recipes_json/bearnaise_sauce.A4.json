Boil for 2–3 minutes to reduce by a third. Once strained, you should have about 3 tbsp. Cool slightly.  Melt the butter in a pan over a slow heat, until foaming. Continue to cook for 1 minute, or until the foam turns whiteish; skim this and discard. Allow the butter to cool slightly – you should just be able to dip your little finger in.  Whiz the egg yolks and reduction in a blender, or use a hand-held blender. Slowly add the butter in a thin, steady stream, whisking until a light sauce forms. Season with salt and white pepper. Serve warm."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "401.664kJ 96.0kcal", "Fat": "9.9g", "Saturated Fat": "6.0g", "Sugars": "0.1g", "Salt": "trace"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/0806090-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
