Lightly grease a baking sheet and dust it with a little flour. Measure the flour and baking powder into a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt. Stir in the cubes of butter until they are coated with flour, then start rubbing them in with your fingertips until the mixture begins to resemble wet sand. Alternatively, place the flour, baking powder, butter and salt in a food processor, and pulse the mixture until it resembles wet sand."}, {"step": "Measure out half the milk into a jug. Break the egg into the jug, then whisk it lightly with a fork."}, {"step": "Take a blunt knife and use it to mix the sugar through the flour and butter. Pour the milk and egg mixture over, and stir it in. Gradually add the remaining milk (you might not need it all), continuing to mix until the dough comes together. It needs to be a soft dough, but not so wet that it is too sticky to pick up."}, {"step": "Lightly dust the work surface and your rolling pin with flour. Scoop the dough out onto the work surface, shape into a circle and gently roll it out until it is 3cm thick."}, {"step": "Dip your cutter in flour to stop it sticking to the dough, then stamp out five rounds of 6cm, dipping the cutter in the flour after each one is stamped out."}, {"step": "Gently knead together the scraps of pastry and roll it out again – you should be able to get another 1 or 2 scones out of the dough by re rolling it. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet and brush the tops with milk for a glazed finish. Bake for 13-15 minutes until golden brown and risen. You can test to see if they are cooked through by tapping them on top – if they are, they’ll sound hollow."}, {"step": "Transfer the scones to a wire rack to cool. Leave them as they are to develop a crusty top, or cover them up with a tea towel and they will soften in their own steam. Serve them warm from the oven with a spoonful or 2 of strawberry jam (you could also use raspberry) and a generous dollop of clotted cream. And, of course, don’t forget the tea – or fizz!"}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,447kJ 585kcals", "Fat": "30.9g", "Saturated Fat": "18.7g", "Carbohydrate": "68.3g", "Sugars": "26.1g", "Protein": "8.4g", "Salt": "0.9g", "Fibre": "1.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/WRWK03032016-scones-with-clotted-cream.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
