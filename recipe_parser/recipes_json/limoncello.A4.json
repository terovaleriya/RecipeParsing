Put all the peel in a large sterilised jar (find a guide to sterilising on the app), cover with the vodka and seal. Store in a dark, cool place for 1 week."}, {"step": "2, When the vodka has infused, strain it through a muslin-lined sieve into a bowl. Put the sugar in a small saucepan with 560ml water and gently bring to a simmer. Swirl and leave to gently bubble away over a low-medium heat for 3 minutes, then remove from the heat (you donâ€™t want the syrup to colour at all). When cool, add half to the strained vodka. Taste and add more syrup until you are happy. The more you add, the sweeter and weaker it will be. Pour into clean bottles and store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or the freezer for up to 2 months. Serve chilled."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/l/20201215_JBWaitroseMag_March2021_Harvest_Recipe_Limoncello.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
