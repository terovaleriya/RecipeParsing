Cut and trim the slices so the basin is lined in a fairly even layer with no gaps. Using a ladle, drain off 150ml of the juice from the fruit and reserve. Ladle the fruit and remaining juice into the basin and cover with the remaining slices of bread, cutting to fit."}, {"step": "Cover with a saucer that fits just inside the rim of the basin and weigh down with a heavy kitchen weight or food cans weighing about 1kg. Chill overnight."}, {"step": "Turn the pudding out onto a serving plate and pour over the reserved juices, then garnish with extra strawberries and a sprig of redcurrant.
