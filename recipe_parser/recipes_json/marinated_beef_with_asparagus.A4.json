Add the beef, turning it to coat with the marinade. Cover and chill overnight, turning occasionally.  Preheat the oven to 200Â°C, gas mark 6. Remove the meat from the marinade and dry off the beef with kitchen paper. Discard the marinade.  Heat a large frying pan with a little olive oil. Sear the fillet on a high heat until brown all over. Place in a non-stick roasting tin and cook for 35 minutes for rare, 50 minutes (medium) or 1 hour (well done). Store in the fridge until ready to transport, but serve at room temperature.  Meanwhile, add the asparagus to a pan of boiling water and cook for 5-6 minutes until just tender. Drain and refresh under cold water.  To make the lemon butter sauce, melt the butter with the lemon zest and juice, and season well. Allow to cool, then chill."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1435.112kJ 343.0kcal", "Fat": "20.8g", "Saturated Fat": "10.9g", "Sugars": "2.7g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/0605ss32-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
