{"title": "Martha Collison's Lamb tagine pie", "tags": null, "planning": {"prep_time": "PT20M", "cook_time": "PT2 hours 55 minutesM", "total_time": "PT3 hours 15 minutesM", "serves": "6 - 8"}, "ingredients": [{"item": "1 tsp ground cinnamon"}, {"item": "1 tsp ground ginger"}, {"item": "1 tsp ground coriander"}, {"item": "½ tsp paprika"}, {"item": "½ tsp cayenne pepper"}, {"item": "1kg diced lamb shoulder"}, {"item": "2 tbsp olive oil"}, {"item": "2 onions, finely chopped"}, {"item": "3 cloves garlic, crushed"}, {"item": "100g pitted prunes"}, {"item": "50g raisins"}, {"item": "100g dried apricots, chopped"}, {"item": "2 x 395g cans Waitrose Peeled Italian Cherry Tomatoes"}, {"item": "500ml lamb stock"}, {"item": "270g pack Jus-Rol Filo Sheets"}, {"item": "75g butter, melted"}, {"item": "50g ground almonds"}, {"item": "Pinch of ground coriander"}, {"item": "50g flaked almonds, toasted"}, {"item": "5 dried apricots, finely chopped"}, {"item": "Honey for drizzling"}], "instructions": [{"step": "Mix the spices together in a small bowl with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Place the lamb chunks into a large bowl, then sprinkle the spice mix over the top. Use your hands to fully coat the meat, then set aside to marinate."}, {"step": "Heat the oil in a large casserole with a fitted lid. Gently fry the onion and garlic over a medium heat until soft and lightly browned – this will take around 10 minutes. Remove the onion mixture from the pan and reserve, then sear the spiced lamb in 2 batches until it is brown all over. Put the onions back into the pan, along with the dried fruits, tomatoes and stock. Bring to a simmer, cover and leave to cook for 2 hours. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan."}, {"step": "While the filling is simmering, make the pastry coil. Clear a large space on your work surface and lay out the sheets of filo in a long line, overlapping them at the edges. If your work surface is small, you can make more than one roll and join them together."}, {"step": "Use a pastry brush to spread melted butter over the length of the pastry, reserving a small amount for the top. Sprinkle the ground almonds, coriander, apricots and half the flaked almonds over the sheets, and then drizzle a small amount of honey on the top. Starting at the long edge, roll up the pastry into a long, thin roll."}, {"step": "Take the lamb off the heat and pour into a deep pie dish. The pieces of meat should be tender and just starting to fall apart, and the sauce should be thick. If it is not, simmer with the lid off on a high heat, stirring until it thickens. Leave to cool and preheat the oven to 170°C, gas mark 3."}, {"step": "Arrange the long pastry roll in a coil over the top of the tagine mix. Brush with the remaining melted butter, sprinkle with the other half of the almonds and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is a deep golden brown. Serve with fresh green vegetables."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,998kJ 719kcals", "Fat": "45.5g", "Saturated Fat": "18.2g", "Carbohydrate": "44.9g", "Sugars": "26.1g", "Protein": "32.4g", "Salt": "0.8g", "Fibre": "5.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Tagine_Pie_2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
