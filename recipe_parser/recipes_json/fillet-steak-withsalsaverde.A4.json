Smear the steaks with oil on each side and season with salt and black pepper. When the pan is very hot add ½ tablespoon of oil and quickly add the steaks. Fry for 2 minutes on each side for rare. Do not move the steaks in the pan as soon as you put them in otherwise they will stick – let them form a crust first and then you’ll be able to turn them over when browned."}, {"step": "Once the steak is cooked to your liking, remove from the pan onto a warm plate, and cover with foil and a couple of tea towels to keep warm. Leave to rest for 5-10 minutes. Serve with the salsa verde sauce spooned over and some chicory leaves, if desired."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,119kJ 511kcals", "Fat": "41g", "Saturated Fat": "8.5g", "Carbohydrate": "0.9g", "Sugars": "0.5g", "Protein": "34g", "Salt": "1.7g", "Fibre": "0.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/f/Fillet-Steak-Salsa-Verde.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
