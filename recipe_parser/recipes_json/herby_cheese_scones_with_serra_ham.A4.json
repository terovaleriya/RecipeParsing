Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment.  Place the flour, seasoning, bicarbonate of soda and butter in a large mixing bowl. Rub together with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Fold in the buttermilk, cheese, tomatoes and basil, then lightly knead until you have a sticky dough.  Turn the dough out onto a floured board. Dust the top with a little flour then use your hands to press the dough evenly into a round, about 3cm deep. Using a 7.5cm cutter, cut out 8 scones, gently reforming the off-cuts as you go. Place on the baking sheet, spacing them out well, and bake in the oven for 15 minutes until golden brown. Serve warm with the Serrano ham."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1096.208kJ 262.0kcal", "Fat": "12.6g", "Saturated Fat": "7.1g", "Sugars": "2.2g", "Salt": "1.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/h/Waitrose-April-Recipe-Cards0040-2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
