In a saucepan, place the shallot, half the tarragon, the vinegar and 3 tablespoons of cold water. Simmer gently until the liquid has reduced by half.  Place the egg yolks in a liquidiser and add the shallot mixture. Blend until smooth. In a saucepan, melt the butter until it is bubbling. With the liquidiser on, carefully pour in the hot butter a little at a time to form a thick, yellow sauce. Taste and adjust seasoning. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and stir in the remaining tarragon. Pour into a warm sauce jug.  Preheat a griddle pan or frying pan until it gets very hot. Brush both sides of each steak with a little olive oil, and season. Fry the steaks until cooked to your liking. Serve immediately with spoonfuls of the Béarnaise sauce, garnished with watercress."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0303sps24-r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
