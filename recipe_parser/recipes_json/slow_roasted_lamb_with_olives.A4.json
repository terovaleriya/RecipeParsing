Unroll the lamb joint and place on a board with the fat side face down. Trim off any areas of excess fat. Season with plenty of black pepper and spread with the anchovy paste. Scatter with about two-thirds of the olives, the garlic, raisins and about two-thirds of the coriander.  Roll up the meat and secure at 4cm intervals with kitchen string. Place in a small roasting tin with the join underneath and season. Roast for 30 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 150°C, gas mark 2 and roast for a further 2½ hours.  Mix the honey with the lemon zest and juice. Drain off all the fat from the roasting tin and brush the meat with the honey glaze. Scatter the reserved olives into the tin and return to the oven for a further 30 minutes, basting once or twice with the glaze. Cover and leave to rest for 20 minutes.  Transfer the lamb to a serving platter and discard the string. Pile the olives and remaining coriander on top to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1811.672kJ 433.0kcal", "Fat": "24.1g", "Saturated Fat": "10.1g", "Sugars": "10.3g", "Salt": "1.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/201003-seasons-spring-r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
