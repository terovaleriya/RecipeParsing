Roughly chop 50g white chocolate and heat gently in a small pan with the cream and 30g sugar, stirring often, until melted (about 3-4 minutes). Stir in the beaten pulp, then sieve into a jug, rubbing the mixture through with a spatula, scraping any from the underside of the sieve and discarding the leftover pips. Roughly chop 60g raspberries and fold in – don’t crush them too much. Divide between the tartlet cases and chill for at least 2 hours, or until set."}, {"step": "Sprinkle the tops evenly with the remaining 30g sugar and caramelise with a kitchen blowtorch. Leave to set for a few minutes. Use a vegetable peeler to scrape the remaining 50g chocolate into curls or shavings.
