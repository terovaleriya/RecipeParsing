Rinse in a colander and then place in a large saucepan with 2.5L water. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then turn down to medium and simmer for 25 minutes until the beans start to become tender. If using cans of beans, see my tip below left."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, to make the dumplings, combine the flour with a large pinch of salt and the other optional ingredients, if using, in a bowl then carefully pour in 60ml water with one hand, while combining them with the other until a dough consistency is formed. If the mix is too wet, add more flour until you can roll the dough about in your hands without leaving any residue. Once this is done, wrap in clingfilm, place in a bowl and refrigerate."}, {"step": "Add the vegetables, garlic and whole scotch bonnet, if using, to the soup and cook for a further 25 minutes."}, {"step": "Remove the dumpling dough from the fridge. Tear off small pieces and roll into the size of your little finger until smooth. Repeat until all the dough is used. Remove the lid from the stew, stir in the coconut milk and all the remaining soup ingredients, then add the dumplings. Simmer for 15 minutes, until the dumplings are cooked through. If you find the stew consistency too thick, add a little water as needed."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,643kJ 392kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "11g", "Carbohydrate": "52g", "Sugars": "9.2g", "Protein": "10g", "Salt": "1.8g", "Fibre": "11g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/j/Jamaicankidneybeansoup.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
