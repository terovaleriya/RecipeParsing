Cut the pineapple into 1cm thick slices and trim off the skin. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat and place the pineapple slices into the hot, dry pan. You may need to do this in batches. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side until lightly charred. Remove from the pan and leave to cool. Blitz the charred slices in a blender until totally smooth."}, {"step": "Add 250ml of blended pineapple, the sugar and 250ml water to a small saucepan. Stir and bring to a rolling boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Cool and strain into a lidded container. Refrigerate until needed."}, {"step": "For the margarita (to make two, you can double the recipe), put all the ingredients into a cocktail shaker with plenty of ice, cover and shake vigorously for 10 seconds.
