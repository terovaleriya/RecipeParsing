Chop the tomatoes and cucumber into 6mm dice. Deseed and finely dice the chilli.

Cover and bring to the boil, then simmer for 6 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed. Meanwhile, finely chop the parsley and the mint leaves.

Heat a large frying pan, add the oil and aubergine with the cinnamon and cook in batches for 5-8 minutes, turning often, until the slices are browned and tender. Try to resist adding more oil as the aubergine will start to yield the oil back as it cooks."}, {"step": "Dice the feta and stir into the tabouleh, then turn out onto a serving platter. Top with the aubergine slices and pine nuts. Serve immediately, with extra lemon for squeezing over, if you wish."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,571kj/615kcals", "Fat": "35.8g", "Saturated Fat": "11.7g", "Carbohydrate": "55.4g", "Sugars": "9.1g", "Salt": "1.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/2014wked-March-r3spicedsalad.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
