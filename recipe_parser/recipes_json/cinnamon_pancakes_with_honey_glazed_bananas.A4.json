Leave to stand for 20 minutes, or until the bananas have absorbed the rum.  Meanwhile, to make the pancake batter, sift the flour, salt and cinnamon into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Whisk in the egg and gradually beat in the milk, drawing in the flour from the sides to make a smooth batter.  Use kitchen paper dipped in oil to lightly oil a 20cm heavy-based non-stick frying pan. Add just enough batter to thinly coat the pan's base and cook over a moderate heat for about 1 minute, or until golden brown. Turn over and cook the other side until golden brown.  Transfer to a warm plate and cover with a square of greaseproof paper. Repeat with the remaining batter to make 8 pancakes. Keep warm by placing them in the oven at 100°C, gas mark 1⁄2, until required.  Pour the honey over the rum-soaked bananas and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes, until the bananas have softened slightly and are caramelised. Serve 2 pancakes per person, folded in half, then in half again, and place the bananas and syrup on top. Dust with icing sugar and serve with 1 tablespoon of the fromage frais."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1962.296kJ 469.0kcal", "Fat": "9.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/0301ws04-r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
