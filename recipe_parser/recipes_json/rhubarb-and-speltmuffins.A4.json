Line 8 of the holes in a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases. Combine the melted butter, buttermilk, egg, vanilla and clementine zest in a small bowl. Put the flours, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and caster sugar in a large bowl, then pour in the egg mixture. Fold together until combined; there should be no pockets of flour, but it should still look lumpy. Fold through most of the rhubarb, keeping some back for the topping."}, {"step": "Divide the mixture evenly between the paper cases, topping each with some of the reserved rhubarb, then scatter over the demerara sugar. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until well risen and golden; a skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean. Remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack before serving."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "863kJ 205kcals", "Fat": "7.6g", "Saturated Fat": "4.4g", "Carbohydrate": "29.6g", "Sugars": "13.1g", "Protein": "4.6g", "Salt": "0.3g", "Fibre": "1.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/speltMuffins_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
