You should end up with 6 long, thin pieces of cake."}, {"step": "Divide the marzipan into 6 equal pieces. Lightly dust a clean work surface with cornflour and roll out each piece of marzipan until roughly 16 x 9cm in size and the thickness of a £1 coin. Brush the top with apricot jam and lay one of the fruit cake fingers onto the front edge. Roll up the finger, trimming any leftovers so the cake is perfectly wrapped, but left open at each end."}, {"step": "Brush the wrapped fruit cake with apricot jam then press all sides into the blitzed pistachios until it is well coated all over. Repeat with the remaining slices of cake and marzipan. Cut each finger into 8 pieces and store in an airtight container for up to 4 days."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "385kJ 92kcals", "Fat": "3.6g", "Saturated Fat": "0.4g", "Carbohydrate": "13.2g", "Sugars": "12g", "Protein": "1.6g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/SimnelBites_0862.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
