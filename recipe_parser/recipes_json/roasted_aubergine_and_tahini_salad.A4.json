Cut the aubergines into 2cm chunks and scatter in 1 or 2 large roasting tins. Quarter the onions so they remain intact at the root ends and add to the tin. Drizzle with 3 tbsp of the oil and roast for 25 minutes. Stir in the peppers and return to the oven for a further 25 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened and lightly caramelised.  Mix the tahini paste in a bowl with the lemon juice, garlic and a little seasoning. Stir in about 3 tbsp water to give a smooth, creamy consistency.  Transfer the vegetables to a serving platter and drizzle with the remaining oil. Spoon the dressing over the top. Scatter with the parsley and lemon zest to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "861.904kJ 206.0kcal", "Fat": "15.1g", "Saturated Fat": "2.1g", "Sugars": "10.4g", "Salt": "trace"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/roast_veg_19197-1_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
