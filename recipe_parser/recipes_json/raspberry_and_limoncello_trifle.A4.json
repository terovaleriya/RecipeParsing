Slice each pair into quarters, then place in a 2-litre glass bowl.  Drizzle the cake with limoncello. Scatter the raspberries over the cake, reserving a few for decoration. Using an electric mixer, gently whisk the mascarpone and custard together until smooth. Spread the custard over the raspberries.  Whip the cream until the whisk leaves a soft trail, then spread on top of the custard. Scatter the top of the trifle with the pistachios and the reserved raspberries."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2058.528kJ 492.0kcal", "Fat": "38.8g", "Saturated Fat": "23.4g", "Sugars": "18.9g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/pud-xmas-r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
