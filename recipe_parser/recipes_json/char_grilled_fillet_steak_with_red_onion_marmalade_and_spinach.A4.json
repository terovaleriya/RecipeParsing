Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan over a medium-low heat and add the red onions. Cook gently for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until very soft and starting to caramelise. Add the sugar, balsamic vinegar and seasoning and cook for a further 10 minutes, again stirring from time to time.  Place the spinach in a large saucepan with just 3 tbsp of water, cover and cook over a medium heat for 6-8 minutes until the spinach starts to wilt. Stir in the butter and nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Drain well.  Heat a griddle pan over a high heat, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil, and griddle the steaks for 10-12 minutes on each side, depending on how well done you like your steak. Alternatively, cook the steaks under a hot grill.  Divide the spinach between two plates, top with the steak and onion marmalade then scatter with cheese and serve."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/0202014-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
