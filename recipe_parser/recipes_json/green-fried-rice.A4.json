Add the salad onions and cook for a minute or so, stirring. Add the ginger, garlic and chillies to the pan. Stir-fry briskly for 1 minute more, not allowing the ingredients to sit still as they will burn. Add the pak choi stalks only (reserving the leaves), quickly followed by the rice. Stir-fry for 3 minutes."}, {"step": "Turn the heat down slightly, push the rice mixture to the side of the pan and add the remaining 1 tbsp oil to the base. Pour the eggs in and allow to set underneath, pulling the set egg into the centre and tilting the pan to replace with uncooked egg. Once an omelette of sorts has formed, throw the pak choi leaves in and fold the whole lot through the rice to break the egg up. Stir through the coriander and soy sauce, and serve with a drizzle of sweet chilli sauce, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (4) 1513kJ 361kcals", "Fat": "16.2g", "Saturated Fat": "3.7g", "Carbohydrate": "34.4g", "Sugars": "9.1g", "Protein": "13.3g", "Salt": "1.6g", "Fibre": "2.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/g/Green-fried-rice.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
