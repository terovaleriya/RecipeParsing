Lightly grease 2 x 20cm sandwich tins and line the bases with parchment. Toast the peanuts in a dry pan set over a medium-high heat, tossing regularly until golden, about 4-5 minutes. Set aside and wipe the pan clean. Gently heat 75g honey and 75g sugar until the sugar has dissolved. Cook over a medium-high heat, without stirring, for 2-3 minutes, to make a rich, golden caramel. Tip in the peanuts and stir gently to coat, then pour onto a parchment-lined tray. Cool completely, then chop, blitz in a food processor or bash with a rolling pin in a sealed bag until roughly ground; you want some large and some small pieces. Cream the butter with the remaining 125g sugar and 25g honey until light and fluffy, then beat in the mashed banana, lemon juice, egg yolks and peanut butter. Stir in the flour, baking powder, salt and 3⁄4 of the caramelised peanuts (keep the larger pieces for decoration). In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks using electric beaters. Carefully fold through the cake batter until evenly mixed. Divide between the tins and bake for 30-35 minutes until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack, remove the parchment, and leave to cool completely. For the buttercream, use electric beaters to mix together the butter, peanut butter and icing sugar. Increase the speed for 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 tbsp double cream until smooth and spreadable. Transfer one cake to a stand and spread over the caramel sauce. Top with 1⁄2 the sliced bananas, then the cream. Sit the other cake on top and cover with the buttercream. Decorate with the remaining bananas and peanuts."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,646kJ 633kcals", "Fat": "36g", "Saturated Fat": "15.8g", "Carbohydrate": "65.1g", "Sugars": "47.8g", "Protein": "12.2g", "Salt": "0.5g", "Fibre": "2.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/banoffee and peanut butter cake.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
