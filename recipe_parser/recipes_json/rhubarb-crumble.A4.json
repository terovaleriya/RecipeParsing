Put the rhubarb in an ovenproof dish (about 1 litre in volume). Sprinkle about 3 tbsp water over the top, along with the caster sugar."}, {"step": "Sift the flour into a mixing bowl. Add the cubed butter and use your fingers to rub the flour and butter together until it looks like very fine breadcrumbs (this is my favourite part). Stir in the demerara sugar."}, {"step": "Evenly spread the crumble over the rhubarb; don’t pat it down too much. Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Don’t worry if you can see the pinkish-red rhubarb syrup through the edges because that is meant to happen. Serve hot with single cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,689kJ 402kcals", "Fat": "14.4g", "Saturated Fat": "9.2g", "Carbohydrate": "63.9g", "Sugars": "38.2g", "Protein": "4.1g", "Salt": "trace", "Fibre": "2.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/Kids_Cooking_5_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
