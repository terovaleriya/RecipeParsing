Cut the beetroot into halves or quarters, depending on size (no piece should be larger than a golf ball). Place in the centre of a large piece of foil, toss with 2 tbsp olive oil and add the balsamic vinegar and rosemary; season. Scrunch the edges of the foil together to make a loose but tightly sealed parcel. Place on a baking tray and bake for 40-60 minutes, until tender. Set aside to cool to room temperature."}, {"step": "Remove the rosemary from the beetroot parcel and discard. Tip the beetroot and any juices into a serving bowl.
