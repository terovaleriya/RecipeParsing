Thinly roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and cut out 8 rounds using a 10cm plain cutter. Press the pastry rounds into the sections of a deep muffin tin. Tear eight pieces of kitchen foil into 10cm squares and press one into each pastry shell. (This will stop the pastry shrinking during baking.)  Bake for 10 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for a further 4-5 minutes until the pastry is lightly golden. As soon as they have cooled enough to handle, transfer to a wire cooling rack.  Stir the icing sugar and vanilla extract into the crème fraîche and spoon into the pastry cases. Halve the strawberries, leaving any small ones whole, and arrange on top.  Melt the redcurrant jelly in a small saucepan with 1 tablespoon cold water. Brush over the strawberries until generously coated."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1405.824kJ 336.0kcal", "Fat": "20.6g", "Saturated Fat": "9.0g", "Sugars": "14.8g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0605ss08-r04.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
