Grease a 20 x 30cm tin and line with baking parchment. Put the butter, sugar and syrup into a large heavy-based saucepan. Heat the mixture gently, stirring occasionally, until the butter has completely melted and the sugar has almost dissolved. Mix the oats into the hot sugar and butter, and stir together until all the oats are completely coated. Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and use the back of a spatula to press it down into an even layer. For soft and chewy flapjacks, bake for 15 minutes so the top has just started to caramelise and is a light golden colour. For crunchy flapjacks, bake for a further ten minutes. Leave to cool for five minutes in the tin,then use a sharp knife to mark into bars or squares. The flapjacks will keep in an airtight container for up to ten days."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Flapjacks2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
