Line 2-3 baking trays with baking parchment.  In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric hand whisk or a wooden spoon, until pale and creamy. Add the egg and the vanilla extract, a little at a time, and continue beating until they are thoroughly combined.  Use a metal spoon to stir in the flour, baking powder, chocolate and cranberries, plus 2 tablespoons of cold water, and mix until they are thoroughly combined.  Place heaped teaspoons of the mixture onto the baking trays, leaving plenty of space between them for the cookies to expand during cooking.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden. Remove from the oven and leave on the baking trays for 2-3 minutes, then place on cooling racks. When cooled, store in an airtight container and eat within 2 days."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "631.784kJ 151.0kcal", "Fat": "8.3g", "Saturated Fat": "5.2g", "Sugars": "12.1g", "Salt": "0.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/w/4-wheatfree-cookies00011_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
