  "instructions": [{"step": "Preheat the oven to 160°C, gas mark 3. Melt the butter. Whizz the ginger nuts to crumbs in a food processor, add the melted butter and briefly whizz again. (If you don’t have a food processor, put the biscuits in a large freezer bag, seal it and bash with a rolling pin before mixing the crumbs and melted butter in a bowl.) Tip the buttery crumbs into a lightly oiled, 20cm square, loose-bottomed cake tin. Press down with the back of a spoon to make an even layer, and put the tin on a baking tray."},
