Line a rectangular brownie tray measuring about 30cm x 20cm x 3cm with baking parchment, snipping the corners to make a good fit.  Cream the butter and sugar together with a wooden spoon or electric hand whisk until pale and fluffy. Beat in the egg a little at a time. Sieve the flour into the mixture and, using a large metal spoon, fold in with the ground almonds. Add the milk and mix gently until it is thoroughly combined and of a dropping consistency.  Spoon the mixture into the tin and level with a round-bladed knife. Press the plums into the top of the cake mixture in rows of 3, cut-side up. Scatter the flaked almonds over and bake for 40-45 minutes, until risen and lightly golden, and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the cake.  Leave in the tin for 10 minutes before placing the cake on a cooling rack. Sift the icing sugar over to finish."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1489.504kJ 356.0kcal", "Fat": "20.4g", "Saturated Fat": "10.0g", "Sugars": "23.4g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/plumtray_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
