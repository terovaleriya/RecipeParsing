Grease an 18cm square tin and line the base with greaseproof paper. Whisk together the eggs and sugar, then slowly whisk in the oil. Stir in the remaining cake ingredients, combining well.  Turn the mixture into the tin, place on a baking sheet and bake for 25–30 minutes. When it’s cooked, a skewer will come out with a few moist crumbs on it. Remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.  For the icing, beat together the cream cheese, icing sugar and orange zest and spread over the cake. Decorate with the kumquats or walnuts, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1510.424kJ 361.0kcal", "Fat": "17.3g", "Saturated Fat": "7.9g", "Sugars": "40.9g", "Salt": "0.28g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/201103ed50r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
