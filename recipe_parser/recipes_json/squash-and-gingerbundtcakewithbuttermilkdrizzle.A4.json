Generously grease a 2.4-litre, 26cm x 9.5cm bundt tin and dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Steam the squash over simmering water for 12-15 minutes, until completely tender. Drain on kitchen paper, then mash with a fork in a mixing bowl. Stir in the ginger and golden syrup."}, {"step": "Sieve the flour, raising agents, spices and salt into a mixing bowl. Stir in the almonds. In a third bowl, beat the butter and muscovado sugar with electric beaters for about 5 minutes, until pale and fluffy. Add ½ the beaten egg and a spoonful of the flour mixture, then beat again until fully incorporated. Repeat with the remaining egg. Gently fold in the remaining flour mixture, the squash mixture and 150ml buttermilk. Tip into the bundt tin and bake for 40-45 minutes, until risen and firm to the touch."}, {"step": "Place the cake on a wire rack and allow to cool upside down in the tin for 2 minutes, then hold the rack up against the tin opening with a cloth, flip and shake firmly once to remove the cake."}, {"step": "For the drizzle, combine the remaining 25ml buttermilk with the icing sugar and enough lemon juice to make a sticky, stiff icing that thickly coats the back of a spoon. Drizzle over the cake, allowing it to drape down the sides. Scatter with crystallised ginger and leave to set for 15 minutes before slicing."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,735kJ 413kcals", "Fat": "17.8g", "Saturated Fat": "9.6g", "Carbohydrate": "57.3g", "Sugars": "43.6g", "Protein": "6g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "1.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Waitrose_Oct-17_Harvest_Bundt-cake.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
