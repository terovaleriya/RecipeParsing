Mince the chicken in a processor. Peel the outer layer from the lemon grass; finely chop the stalk. Put all the ingredients, except the oil and chilli jam, in a bowl. Season and mix together.  Wet your hands; shape the mixture into 30 balls, each about 3cm in diameter, and lightly flatten to form small patties.  In a large frying pan, heat the oil over a medium heat. Fry the patties in batches until thoroughly cooked – about 2 minutes on each side. Keep them warm in the oven as you fry the rest. Serve with Rachel Allen's sweet chilli jam."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "171.544kJ 41.0kcal", "Fat": "13.0g", "Saturated Fat": "0.2g", "Sugars": "1.2g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/201011we80r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
