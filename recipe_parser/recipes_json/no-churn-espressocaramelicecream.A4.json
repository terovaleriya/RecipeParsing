Stir until the sugar is dissolved then remove the spoon and bubble, swirling the pan every now and then until it turns golden. Keep a close eye on it. Once it’s reached a deep amber colour, carefully pour in the cream (it will bubble up) and stir over a low heat until combined into a glossy sauce. Stir in the salt and liquid glucose; pour into a bowl and set aside to cool completely."}, {"step": "Once the caramel is cold, dissolve the espresso coffee in 2 tbsp boiling water, set aside to cool. Use electric beaters to whisk the double cream, condensed milk and coffee until the mixture reaches stiff peaks (about 10 minutes). Pour half the coffee mixture into a 1.5 litre container then lightly swirl in ½ the cooled caramel; repeat with the remaining coffee mixture and caramel. Freeze for 8 hours or overnight. Served with crushed caramelised biscuits."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/n/NO-CHURN-ESPRESSO-CARAMEL-ICE-CREAM.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
