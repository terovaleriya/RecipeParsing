Melt 70g butter and mix with the crushed cookies; press into a base-lined 23cm springform tin. Bake for 10 minutes until just firm. Leave to cool slightly, then wrap the tin in two large sheets of tinfoil, double-wrapping it around the outsides (it needs to be watertight), but leaving the top open.  To make the cheesecake, whisk the eggs with the sugar for several minutes, until thick and airy. Scrape in the vanilla pod seeds; beat in all the cream cheese, the cornflour, crème fraîche, coffee and melted chocolate; pour into the tin.  Set the cake tin in a large roasting tin or dish. Pour boiling water into the roasting dish to reach halfway up the cake tin. Bake for about 1 hour 20 minutes until just firm. Turn the oven off and leave for 15 minutes  Meanwhile, make the sauce. In a pan, melt the syrup, 15g butter, cocoa, coffee granules and chopped chocolate over a very low heat with 80ml water. Whisk together until smooth. Keep in the fridge for up to 1 week and warm through gently before serving  Chill the cheesecake overnight, or for up to 4 days, before serving with a drizzle of chocolate sauce"}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "3083.608kJ 737.0kcal", "Fat": "55.0g", "Saturated Fat": "32.0g", "Sugars": "12.0g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/v/200912WFI743.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
