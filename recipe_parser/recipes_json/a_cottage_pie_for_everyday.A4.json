Gently fry the onion with the grated carrot for 4-5 minutes, until the onion is beginning to soften. Add the minced beef and continue to cook for a further 10 minutes, breaking up the meat with the back of a spoon, until browned.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes, hot stock and the Worcestershire sauce. Season, reduce the heat and leave to simmer gently for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 190Â°C, gas mark 5. Cut the potatoes into even-sized chunks, and place into a pan with enough cold water to cover them. Bring to the boil and cook for 10-15 minutes, until tender. Drain thoroughly, return to the pan and mash until smooth. Stir in the butter and milk, then season to taste.  Pour the beef mixture into a 1.5 litre ovenproof, shallow dish. Spoon over the potatoes to cover and use a fork to score the top. Scatter with the grated Cheddar, if using. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the top is crisp and golden, and the centre is piping hot. Serve with essential Waitrose Peas."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1393.272kJ 333.0kcal", "Fat": "15.5g", "Saturated Fat": "6.6g", "Sugars": "6.6g", "Salt": "0.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/a/family_cottage_pie_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
