Fry gently while you strip the coriander leaves from their stalks. Put the leaves in a polythene bag, seal and refrigerate until needed. Finely slice the stems and stir into the onions. When the onions are golden brown and the oil appears to separate from them, stir in the turmeric, cumin, ground coriander and mustard seeds. Cook briskly, stirring regularly, for another 2 minutes then mix in the tomatoes, salt and pepper.  Cook the tomatoes briskly for 10 minutes or until they have collapsed into a mush, making sure they don't catch and burn on the bottom of the saucepan. Add the tamarind, 1 litre of water and half the coriander leaves. Return to the boil, then simmer for 30 minutes.  Pur√©e and strain through a sieve into a clean saucepan. Reheat and adjust the seasoning to taste. Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves and serve with pappadams."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0310038-r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
