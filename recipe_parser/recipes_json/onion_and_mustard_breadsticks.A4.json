Stir until most of the lumps have gone, then leave for 1 hour or until it triples in volume. You can leave it for up to 4 hours if you need to. Meanwhile, melt the butter and gently cook the onion in it for 10 minutes until soft. Cool. Mix the mustard powder, pepper and fine salt with the remaining 125g flour in a separate bowl. Beat the onion into the yeast mixture, add the remaining dry ingredients, and work into a soft, sticky dough. Cover and leave for 45 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 200°C, gas mark 6. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a rectangle roughly 20cm x 10cm and cut 10cm strips about 1cm-2cm wide. Roll each on the work surface till 30cm long. Place on a tray lined with baking parchment and leave for 15 minutes to puff slightly. Brush with oil and sprinkle with salt flakes.  Bake for 30 minutes till crisp and golden, transferring from the tray directly to the oven shelf half way through to dry out."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "456.056kJ 109.0kcal", "Fat": "5.8g", "Saturated Fat": "2.3g", "Sugars": "0.9g", "Salt": "1.0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/o/0603032-r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
