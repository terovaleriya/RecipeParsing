Peel and halve the celeriac and cut into 1cm slices.  Place in a saucepan with enough water to cover, bring up to the boil and cook for 10 minutes until tender.  Drain and leave to dry in a colander.  Grease a 2-litre ovenproof dish with the butter and scatter over the crushed garlic.  Heat the oil in a frying pan over a low heat.  Add the onion and bay leaves and cook for 5 minutes until soft and golden.  Add the wine and bubble for a few minutes, then set aside to cool slightly.  Remove the bay leaves.
