Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt to the other. Add 2 tbsp of olive oil and ¾ of the water then mix using the dough hook on a slow speed, adding more of the water slowly until a smooth dough forms."}, {"step": "Mix the dough for 5-6 minutes on a medium speed until a smooth and elastic dough forms. Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and leave to rise until doubled in size – at least 1 hour and 30 minutes."}, {"step": "While the dough is rising, caramelise the onions for the filling. Heat the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, then add the chopped onions. Allow to soften, which takes about 15 minutes, before adding the sugar, balsamic vinegar, thyme and seasoning. Keeping your eye on the pan, brown the onions until they are darker in colour and give off a sweet smell. This will take another 15 minutes and requires regular stirring to stop the onions catching. Place to one side to cool."}, {"step": "Grease a 30x30cm deep baking tin with butter. Gently knock the dough back by folding it onto itself in the bowl a couple of times, then tip onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a large rectangle, about 2.5cm thick and 30cm long. Use your fingers to spread the soft butter all over the dough, then evenly arrange the onion mixture over the rectangle. Roughly chop the goat’s cheese then sprinkle over the onions."}, {"step": "With the long side facing you, tightly roll the dough making a long sausage roll shape. Slice off both ends, then cut the remaining dough into nine 3cm pieces. Arrange on baking trays, leaving space for the dough to rise again.

When the rolls have risen, remove the trays from the plastic bags, lightly brush the rolls with egg and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,623kj 386kcals", "Fat": "13.9g", "Saturated Fat": "5.7g", "Carbohydrate": "54.9g", "Sugars": "12.6g", "Protein": "10.3g", "Salt": "1.4g", "Fibre": "2.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/TV/Martha's-Picnic-Bake_Caramalised-Onion-&-Goat-Cheese-Chelsea-2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
