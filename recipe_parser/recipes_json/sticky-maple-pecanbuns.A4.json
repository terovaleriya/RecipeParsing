Mix the fl our, sugar, yeast, cinnamon and salt in a freestanding mixer fi tted with a dough hook. Make a well in the centre; pour in the eggs and milk. Mix on slow until you have a rough dough, then turn to a medium speed and bring together to a dough. With the mixer on medium, add the butter, a knob at a time, only adding more once the last piece has been incorporated. When all the butter has been added, knead for a further 4 minutes. Set the dough aside to prove in the bowl, covered with cling fi lm, for 1 hour 30 minutes, until doubled in size."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, grease a 25cm x 35cm deep baking dish. To make the glaze, melt the butter, then stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring to the boil, then simmer for 3-4 minutes. Pour ½ into the tin and spread out evenly."}, {"step": "When the dough has nearly doubled in size, beat all the fi lling ingredients together with a whisk."}, {"step": "On a lightly fl oured surface, roll the dough out to 35cm x 40cm; trim the edges. Spread over the filling and sprinkle with ½ the pecans. Starting from the long edge, roll up into a tight log. Trim the ends and slice into 15 rolls (cut it into 3 pieces, then cut each into 5). Place in the tin, cut-side-up, in 3 rows of 5 buns. Cover with cling fi lm and leave to rise for 45-50 minutes."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 180˚C, gas mark 4. Remove the cling fi lm and bake for 30 minutes. Cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then flip onto a wire rack; you may need to give the tin a tap, before easing the buns from the caramel. Flip the buns over and warm the remaining glaze; brush or drizzle over the top, before sprinkling with the remaining pecans. Serve warm or at room temperature."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,038kJ 488kcals", "Fat": "29.4g", "Saturated Fat": "15.8g", "Carbohydrate": "49.6g", "Sugars": "24.7g", "Protein": "6.3g", "Salt": "0.8g", "Fibre": "1.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/10152207_Waitrose-Kitchen_Maple-Pecan-Buns134990.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
