Beat in the vanilla and eggs, then gently add the flour, baking powder and salt until just combined. Stir in the milk until combined; tip into the cake tin. Level the top; bake for 25 minutes until golden and risen. Set aside to cool in the tin."}, {"step": "Use the overhang to lift the cooled caked from the tin. For the topping, sift the icing sugar into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the vanilla and 2 tbsp milk into the well, gradually drawing the sugar into the liquid until you have a smooth icing. Check the consistency, adding more milk a drop at a time until you can drizzle it over the cake and spread out evenly with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle with the 100s & 1000s, allow to set for at least 5 minutes, then slice into squares when ready to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (15) 1332kJ 321kcals", "Fat": "14g", "Saturated Fat": "8.4g", "Carbohydrate": "45.1g", "Sugars": "32.3g", "Protein": "3.5g", "Salt": "0.35g", "Fibre": "0.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/images/cms/zoom.png"}
