Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan and cook the onion, carrot and leek for 3–4 minutes until softened. Add the mince, break up with a fork, and fry for a few minutes until lightly browned. Stir in the paprika, cumin, ketchup and parsley. Add the stock and seasoning and bring to the boil. Simmer, half covered, for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Transfer to a 2-litre shallow ovenproof dish. While the mince is cooking, put all of both types of potatoes in a pan with cold water to just cover. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10–15 minutes until tender. Drain thoroughly, then return them to the pan and mash with the butter and seasoning until smooth. Spoon over the top of the mince mixture. Rough up the surface with a fork. Bake for 25–30 minutes until golden. Great served with peas or broccoli."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2359.776kJ 564kcals", "Fat": "22.9g", "Saturated Fat": "9.9g", "Carbohydrate": "60.9g", "Sugars": "13.6g", "Salt": "2.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/2010wked38-r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
