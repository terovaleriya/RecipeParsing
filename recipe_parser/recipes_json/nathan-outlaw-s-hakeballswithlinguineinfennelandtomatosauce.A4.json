Sweat for 2 minutes to soften without colouring, then tip onto a plate to cool."}, {"step": "Check the hake fillets for any bones by running your fingers over them and pinch out any you find.

Chill while you make the tomato sauce."}, {"step": "To make the sauce, heat a large frying pan or flameproof casserole dish over a medium heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the onions and cook for 4-5 minutes until translucent. Add the garlic, rosemary and fennel seeds; cook for 2 minutes. Add the fennel slices and cook for 3 minutes. Add the sugar and sherry vinegar and cook for another 30 seconds. Pour in the passata and tinned tomatoes with a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon, then cook gently for 10 minutes."}, {"step": "Carefully put the hake balls in the sauce and cover with a lid. Cook over a low heat for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the linguine according to the pack instructions.

Dress with a drizzle of olive oil and a scattering of basil and parsley.
