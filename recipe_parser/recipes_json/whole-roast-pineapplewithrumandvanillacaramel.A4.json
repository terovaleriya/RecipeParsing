Remove the ‘eyes’ from the flesh, cutting them out in rows by slicing thin diagonal wedges away around the surface of the fruit. This creates a pleasing pattern as well as removing the inedible eyes."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 190˚C, gas mark 5. Put the sugar, vanilla pod and seeds, rum and butter in a small pan. Bring slowly to the boil, stirring to melt the butter, then simmer gently for 1-2 minutes until smooth. Put the pineapple on its side in a medium-sized baking dish and pour over the sauce, turning to coat."}, {"step": "Roast in the centre of the oven for 50-55 minutes, turning every 10 minutes and carefully basting with the sauce. Once the pineapple is caramelised and tender, remove from the oven, discard the vanilla pod and allow to cool for 15 minutes before slicing at the table and serving with the ice cream (or crème fraîche, if liked) and caramel sauce."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,081kJ 496kcals", "Fat": "12g", "Saturated Fat": "7.2g", "Carbohydrate": "68g", "Sugars": "68g", "Protein": "3.4g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "4.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/w/whole-roasted-pineapple-with-vanilla-caramel.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
