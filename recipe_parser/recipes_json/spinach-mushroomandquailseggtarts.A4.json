Roll out the pastry to a rectangle about 15 x 30cm, then cut in half to make 2 squares and place on a baking sheet.  Score a line about 1cm in from the edge around each one. Mix the spinach with the shallot, mushrooms, tomato, pine nuts and melted butter.  Season generously.  Place half of the mixture in the centre of each square, inside the border.  Chill until needed, or for up to 3 hours. Brush the pastry border with beaten egg and bake for 20-25 minutes until risen and golden.  Cut the quail's eggs in half and place on top of the tarts.  Serve immediately with steamed green vegetables, such as tenderstem broccoli, and warm Waitrose Hollandaise Sauce."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,838kj 442kcals", "Fat": "31.2g", "Saturated Fat": "14.8g", "Carbohydrate": "27.4g", "Sugars": "5g", "Protein": "12.8g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "3.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Spinach-mushroom-quails-egg-tarts-2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
