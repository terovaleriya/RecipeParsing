When cold, run the knife along the marks one more time before lifting from the pan."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "843 202", "Fat": "12", "Saturated Fat": "7.3", "Carbohydrate": "22", "Sugars": "7.1", "Protein": "1.9", "Salt": "0.3", "Fibre": "0.7"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Shortbread-Fingers.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
