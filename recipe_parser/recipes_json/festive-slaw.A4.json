Use a vegetable peeler to pare the zest from the clementine and limes into long strips. Put in a saucepan with the juice of the clementine and limes, the cumin seeds, salt and honey. Bring to the boil over a high heat, then turn the heat down to low and simmer for 10 minutes, until the strips of zest have shrunk and started to curl at the edges. Set aside to cool."}, {"step": "Finely slice the salad onions (both the white and green parts) and put in a bowl. Cover with cold water and leave to sit while you chop everything else.
