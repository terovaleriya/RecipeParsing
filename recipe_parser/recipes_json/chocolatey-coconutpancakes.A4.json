You can scatter over a little desiccated coconut, too, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving 1400kJ 333kcals", "Fat": "11g fat", "Saturated Fat": "6.3g saturated fat", "Carbohydrate": "44g carbs", "Sugars": "21g sugars", "Protein": "10g protein", "Salt": "0.5g salt", "Fibre": "5.3g fibre"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/New recipes/4444-feb-recipe-cards-pancakes.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
