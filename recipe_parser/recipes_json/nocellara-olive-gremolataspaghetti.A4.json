Crush the olives by pushing down on them with the flat side of a large knife. Discard the stones. Tip the parsley and olives into a mixing bowl, then add the finely grated zest from the lemon and just half of its juice, plus the garlic, chilli (to taste) and 3 tsp oil."}, {"step": "Drain the pasta, reserving a mugful of water. Return to the pan and add the olive mixture, tossing until well combined. Add a little cooking water to loosen, if needed. Season with just a pinch of salt – you won’t need a lot because the olives are already salty. Sprinkle with extra chilli, if liked. Drizzle the remaining oil and a little lemon juice over the tomatoes and red onion, and serve as a side salad with the pasta."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,775kJ 425kcals", "Fat": "21g", "Saturated Fat": "3.4g", "Carbohydrate": "45g", "Sugars": "5.7g", "Protein": "8.2g", "Salt": "1.7g", "Fibre": "9.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/n/Waitrose-Weekend_WK491_Healthy-Everyday_Nocellara-Olive-Gremolata-Spaghetti.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
