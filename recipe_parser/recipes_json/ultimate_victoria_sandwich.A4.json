Grease 2 x 18cm sandwich or cake tins and line the bases and sides with baking parchment. Place the butter in a mixing bowl with 250g golden caster sugar. Using an electric whisk or wooden spoon, beat the butter and sugar together until the mixture is very pale in colour and fluffy.  Gradually beat the eggs into the creamed mixture, one at a time, until well combined. If the mixture looks a little curdled, don't worry as it won't affect the final result. Sift half the flour into the mixture then, using a large metal spoon, fold it in, lightly cutting through the centre and turning it over each time until no traces of flour remain. Repeat with the remaining flour.  Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and, using a round-bladed knife, smooth the tops of the cakes. Bake both on the centre shelf of the oven for 20-25 minutes. The cakes are cooked when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool for  5 minutes in the tins, then loosen the edge of one cake and invert onto a clean, folded tea towel. Remove the paper and invert onto the cooling rack (this prevents the rack leaving marks on the top of the cake). Repeat with the second cake and leave to cool. Meanwhile, tip the raspberries into a bowl and crush with the back of a spoon, stir in 25g sugar and leave for about 5 minutes.  Select the cake with the best top, then place the other cake, top downwards, onto a flat serving plate. Whip the cream to form soft peaks and spread over the base. Spoon the raspberries over. Place the best cake on the cream and raspberries, top side up. Sprinkle over a little icing or caster sugar, lightly and evenly. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Best eaten on the same day."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1288.672kJ 308.0kcal", "Fat": "19.0g", "Saturated Fat": "11.6g", "Sugars": "20.4g", "Salt": "0.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/u/0906ss20r1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
