This is best done with a mandoline. You can also shave off slices with a vegetable peeler, but you will need to cut the celeriac into smaller pieces first, and the crisps will be smaller and take less time to cook."}, {"step": "Heat 3-4cm oil in a deep saucepan to 180°C (or use a deep-fat fryer). Fry the crisps, a large handful at a time, for about 3-5 minutes, or until just starting to turn pale gold. Scoop out and drain on kitchen paper, dabbing off the oil if necessary. They will still be a bit soft, but will crisp up as they cool."}, {"step": "Once crisp, transfer each batch to a large bowl. When they are all cooked, season them with sea salt or celery salt and toss well to coat. Eat immediately.
