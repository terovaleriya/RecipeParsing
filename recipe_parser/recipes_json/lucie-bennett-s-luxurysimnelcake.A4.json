In a large bowl, mix together the dried fruit, glacé cherries, stem ginger, spices, Amaretto and citrus zest and juices; cover and set aside to soak overnight."}, {"step": "The next day, grease and line the base and sides of a 20cm, loose-bottomed cake tin. Roll out 190g marzipan to a disc slightly smaller than the tin, about 0.5cm thick. Roll the remaining marzipan into 11 even balls (about 10g each) and place on a baking tray; set aside."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 150˚C, gas mark 2.

Spoon over the remaining cake mixture and level the surface again. Bake on the middle shelf for about 2 hours 30 minutes, or until firm to touch and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean; cover with foil for the final 45 minutes if it browns too quickly. Leave in the tin for 15 minutes, then remove and leave to cool completely on a wire rack."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, lightly toast the marzipan balls under a hot grill (about 250˚C) for about 2 minutes; set aside to cool. Place the cake on a plate or stand, and warm the apricot jam in a small pan.  Brush the jam over the cake and decorate with the marzipan balls, toasted almonds and additional dried fruit and stem ginger, glazing with any leftover jam."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,025kJ 482kcals", "Fat": "17.8g", "Saturated Fat": "7.7g", "Carbohydrate": "73.9g", "Sugars": "61.6g", "Protein": "6.5g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "2.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/l/Waitrose-Kitchen-12-01-156977_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
