Spread the hazelnuts out on a tray and roast for 5-6 minutes, until they turn golden. Cool and roughly chop; set aside. Put the saffron threads in a heatproof bowl and cover with 2 tbsp just-boiled water. Steep for 5 minutes. Stir in the honey, chilli flakes, vinegars, parsley and 4 tbsp olive oil, then season. Set aside."}, {"step": "When cutting the 4 cauliflower steaks, the aim is to get 2 vertical slices from either side of the centre of each cauliflower. (Beyond the reach of the central core, the florets won’t hold together in a slab so save these pieces for another dish or simply roast alongside the steaks.) Brush a large baking tray with oil and space the steaks out on it. Brush the tops generously with the remaining oil and season. Roast for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway, until golden and soft. Serve 1 cauliflower steak per person, with the dressing and chopped hazelnuts spooned over the top."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,389kJ 335kcals", "Fat": "26.1g", "Saturated Fat": "3.1g", "Carbohydrate": "14.4g", "Sugars": "10.8g", "Protein": "7.7g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "5.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/Roast-cauliflower-steaks.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
