Roll out the pastry onto a lightly floured work surface and cut out 6 circles, 12cm in diameter and about 4mm thick. Transfer to a  non-stick baking tray.  Mix together the ground almonds with the apple and pear juice, then spread over the pastry circles to within 1cm of the edges.  Arrange the slices of pear over the almond mixture. Gently heat the honey and brush over the pears, then bake for 20-25 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.  Meanwhile, heat the apricot jam until bubbling. Allow to cool slightly then sieve, to remove the apricot pieces, and brush over the pear to glaze. Heat the chocolate sauce according to pack instructions and drizzle over the galettes; when ready, serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2723.784kJ 651.0kcal", "Fat": "34.4g", "Saturated Fat": "16.0g", "Sugars": "51.7g", "Salt": "1.0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0809r07.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
