Place the hazelnuts on a baking tray and put in the oven to toast until lightly coloured all over – about 4-5 minutes. Remove about 25g of the hazelnuts and set aside. Place the rest in a food processor and blitz until coarsely chopped."}, {"step": "Place the butter in a bowl and beat together with the sugar until light and creamy. Gradually add the maple syrup along with the egg and continue to mix. Gradually add the flour, ground hazelnuts and chocolate chips, and mix until you have a soft dough-like mixture. Tip this out onto a sheet of clingfilm and roll into a long, thick sausage shape about 7cm in diameter. Place in the fridge and chill for about an hour."}, {"step": "Reduce the oven temperature to 160°C, gas mark 3. Line two baking trays with parchment paper. Unwrap the dough and cut into 16 cookies. Place them on the baking trays. Chop the remaining hazelnuts and scatter over the top, pressing them down gently. Bake for 20 minutes until golden brown. Place the cookies on a wire rack and leave to cool for a few minutes, then serve warm on their own or with vanilla ice cream if you wish."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "846kJ 203kcals", "Fat": "12.4g", "Saturated Fat": "5.5g", "Carbohydrate": "19.9g", "Sugars": "10.2g", "Protein": "2.9g", "Salt": "trace g", "Fibre": "0.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/w/Waitrose-Weekend_WK295_WKend-Menu_Sun-Pudding_Warm-Choc-Chip-&-Hazlenut-Cookies.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
