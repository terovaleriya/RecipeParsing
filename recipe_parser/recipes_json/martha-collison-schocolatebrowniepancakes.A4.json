Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients."}, {"step": "In a small jug, beat together the milk, vanilla and egg. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the well you’ve made in the dry ingredients, whisking until the mixture is smooth."}, {"step": "Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, swirling it round to coat the base, then beat into the batter. Leave the frying pan on the heat, ready to fry the pancakes."}, {"step": "Use an ice-cream scoop or pour a few tbsp of batter into the centre of the frying pan. Try to get as close to a circle (about 10cm in size) as you can so the finished pancakes stack neatly on top of each other. Cook the pancakes for 1 minute on each side and then place onto a serving plate. Repeat the cooking process with the remaining batter, using a little oil for frying if necessary, until you have 12 pancakes."}, {"step": "To make the chocolate sauce, heat the cream and honey in a small pan until steaming. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate until it melts and the sauce is smooth. Serve the pancakes in stacks, drenched with chocolate sauce and scattered with a few raspberries."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,048kJ 491kcals", "Fat": "31.6g", "Saturated Fat": "19.3g", "Carbohydrate": "43.3g", "Sugars": "18g", "Protein": "8.4g", "Salt": "1.6g", "Fibre": "2.4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/WRWK230217-martha-pancakes.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
