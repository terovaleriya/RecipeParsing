Unroll the pastry, still on its paper, working quickly to keep it cool. Trim the pastry to about 35cm long, then cut into 3 rectangles, about 10-12cm wide. Cut horizontally into 6 even strips, to make 18 small rectangles in total. Space out on the parchment. Dust with icing sugar and cover with a second sheet of parchment. Sit a second baking sheet on top and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is golden, crisp and glazed. Transfer to a wire rack to cool."}, {"step": "Whisk the custard, cream and vanilla paste together until firm and thick. Put a pastry rectangle on each of 6 serving plates. Pipe or spoon a layer of the custard mixture over, leaving a border to allow for spreading. Top with a neat layer of strawberry slices, then repeat the layers once more. Finish each with a final pastry rectangle and dust generously with icing sugar."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per millefeuille 1780kJ 428kcals", "Fat": "30g", "Saturated Fat": "16g", "Carbohydrate": "32g", "Sugars": "16g", "Protein": "4.4g", "Salt": "0.5g", "Fibre": "4g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Strawberry-millefeuille-2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
