Soak 12 cocktail sticks in cold water for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, butterfly the sardine and put on a parchment-lined baking tray, skin-side down. Put the breadcrumbs, pine nuts, raisins, vinegar and parsley in a bowl, season and mix together. Spoon some of the mixture onto each sardine (don’t worry if bits fall onto the tray). Drizzle over the olive oil."}, {"step": "Fold or roll the sardines widthways to enclose the filling and secure with a pre-soaked cocktail stick. (Again, it doesn’t matter if the filling falls out a little.) Bake for 15 minutes, until the sardines are lightly golden and cooked through, and the breadcrumbs have started to crisp up and turn golden. Sprinkle with extra parsley and serve with the lemon wedges, plus a green salad, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,448kJ 347kcals", "Fat": "20.9g", "Saturated Fat": "4.1g", "Carbohydrate": "14g", "Sugars": "6.4g", "Protein": "25.7g", "Salt": "0.5g", "Fibre": "0.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/SICILIAN-STYLE-SARDINES-2048X2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
