Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment. In a freestanding mixer (or using electric beaters), beat the butter for 5-6 minutes until pale and soft. Tip in the icing sugar and vanilla; beat for 2 minutes. Use a metal spoon to fold in the custard powder, flour and baking powder along with a pinch of salt, then stir in the milk."}, {"step": "Spoon the dough into a piping bag fitted with a large star nozzle and massage the bag a little to soften the mixture. Pipe 10-12 5cm-diameter rosettes (a spiral from the outside edge inwards) onto each tray, leaving space between to allow for spreading. Chill for 20 minutes. Bake one tray at a time in the centre of the oven for 12-14 minutes until the biscuits are golden at the edges. Leave to cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool."}, {"step": "For the filling, use electric beaters to beat the butter for 5-6 minutes until pale. Add the vanilla and icing sugar then beat again until light and fluffy. Spoon the buttercream into a clean piping bag fitted with the star nozzle. Put the raspberries and lemon juice in a small saucepan; heat gently until the berries begin to break down, then simmer for 3-4 minutes until thickened. Transfer to a small bowl then mix in the jam; set aside to cool."}, {"step": "Fill the biscuits just before serving. Leaving a thin border, pipe a buttercream swirl on the underside of ½ the biscuits. Spread the underside of the remaining biscuits with a little jam mixture. Sandwich the halves together, gently squeezing the filling to the edges. Dust with icing sugar to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per biscuit (12) 1490kJ 357kcals", "Fat": "21g", "Saturated Fat": "13g", "Carbohydrate": "40g", "Sugars": "26g", "Protein": "2g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "1.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Strawberry-and-raspberry-viennese-whirls.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
