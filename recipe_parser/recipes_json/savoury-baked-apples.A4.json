Put the oil and butter in a large non-stick pan set over a medium heat. When hot, add the onion, bacon (if using) and rosemary; sauté for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onion is softened and the bacon is cooked through. Add the garlic and sauté for another few minutes until aromatic. Stir in the balsamic vinegar and season. Remove from the heat."}, {"step": "Carefully core the apples, ensuring each fruit remains intact (use an apple corer or paring knife). Cut a thin sliver off the base of each apple so they can sit upright. Put on a baking tray and stuff the apples with the onion mixture, pressing it in firmly so they are as generously filled as possible. Scatter any remaining stuffing over the apples. Cover with foil and bake for 20-30 minutes, until tender to the point of a knife. Take care not to overcook them, as they go from tender to falling apart very quickly."}, {"step": "Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a serving platter. Season, scatter over the parsley and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Serve immediately alongside pork chops, roasted meats or fish steaks, such as salmon or halibut."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "715kJ 171kcals", "Fat": "7.5g", "Saturated Fat": "2.5g", "Carbohydrate": "22g", "Sugars": "19g", "Protein": "2.9g", "Salt": "0.3g", "Fibre": "2.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Savoury-baked-apples.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
