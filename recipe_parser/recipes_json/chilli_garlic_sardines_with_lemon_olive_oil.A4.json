Open out the fish and place flesh-side down on a chopping board, pressing down firmly along the backbone with your fingers until the fish is flattened.  Turn the fish over and carefully and slowly pull out the backbone, cutting it off at the tail end. Remove any small bones left behind.  Mix the chilli, garlic and oil in a large shallow bowl. Add the sardines and coat well on both sides. If you have time, leave in the fridge to marinate for 10-20 minutes.  Preheat the grill to high or, if cooking on a barbecue, wait until the coals are glowing red under a thin layer of ash. Cook the sardines for about 2-3 minutes on each side until the flesh is opaque. At the same time, grill or barbecue the lemon wedges until starting to char. Serve with a salad of Romaine lettuce, new potatoes and the charred lemon wedges."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1552.264kJ 371.0kcal", "Fat": "23.2g", "Saturated Fat": "5.6g", "Sugars": "1.4g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/0608r09.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
