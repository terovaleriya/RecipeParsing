Grease a 20cm square cake tin and line with baking parchment. In a large heavy-based pan, melt the butter and dark chocolate over a low-medium heat. Take off the heat, add the sugar and eggs, and use a wooden spoon to stir together. Once everything is incorporated, stir in the flour. Pour the chocolate mixture into the lined tin. Bake for 30 minutes, until just set with a slight wobble (don’t test with a skewer). Leave in the tin to cool completely before lifting out and cutting into squares."}, {"step": "To make the drizzle, put the white chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt over a pan of barely simmering water, ensuring the bowl is not touching the water. Once almost melted, take the pan off the hob and stir to finish melting the chocolate. Use a spoon to drizzle over the brownies. Keep in the fridge for up to 4 days, if not eating straight away."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,583kJ 380kcals", "Fat": "23g", "Saturated Fat": "14g", "Carbohydrate": "36g", "Sugars": "27g", "Protein": "5.1g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "2.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/2101020_WaitroseChocolate_Chocolate-Brownies.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
