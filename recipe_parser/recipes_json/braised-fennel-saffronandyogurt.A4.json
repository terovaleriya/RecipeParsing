Cook for 10-12 minutes, turning halfway through, until lightly browned all over."}, {"step": "Drizzle the fennel with the honey and cook for 1-2 minutes more, to caramelise slightly. Pour in the saffron water, bring to the boil, then cover, reduce to a simmer and cook gently for 20-25 minutes, or until the fennel is tender."}, {"step": "Uncover and increase the heat; cook until most of the liquid has evaporated, leaving about 1cm.
