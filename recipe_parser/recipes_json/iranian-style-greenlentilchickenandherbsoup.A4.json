Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large, heavy-based pan. Add the onion with a pinch of salt; soften over a low heat for 10 minutes. Add the garlic, chickpeas, beans, lentils and turmeric; cook for about 2 minutes, stirring, until fragrant. Add 500ml water, bring to the boil then cover the pan and simmer over a low heat for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little extra water if it starts sticking."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, season the chicken and put it in a roasting tin.

Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for 11-12 minutes, until the rice is cooked."}, {"step": "To make crispy onions for the topping, put the flour and sea salt on a plate and toss the sliced onion in it.

Set aside on kitchen paper to drain, then sprinkle with a little more sea salt."}, {"step": "When the chicken is cooked and cool enough to handle, remove the skin and shred the meat, discarding the bones. Add to the soup with the spinach and fresh herbs; cook gently, uncovered, for 4-5 minutes until the greens are wilted and becoming darker. Take off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and season. To serve, divide the soup between 6 bowls, top with the Greek yogurt and sprinkle over the crispy onions and a pinch of dried mint."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,403kJ 573kcals", "Fat": "20g", "Saturated Fat": "3.5g", "Carbohydrate": "48g", "Sugars": "6.1g", "Protein": "43g", "Salt": "0.9g", "Fibre": "13g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/i/Iranian-style-chicken-soup.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
