In a medium saucepan, bring the cream just to the boil, then turn off the heat. Add the rosemary and cover; leave to infuse for 45 minutes. Strain the cream through a fine sieve into a clean pan (discard the rosemary). Add the butter and muscovado sugar and cook over a medium heat, stirring, to dissolve the sugar. Remove the pan from the heat."}, {"step": "In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, combine the caster sugar, golden syrup and 3 tbsp water. Sweep down the sides of the pan with a damp pastry brush so there are no sugar crystals around the edge. Heat the mixture, stirring, until the sugar has dissolved, then bring to the boil. Cover with a lid for 1 minute, then remove; insert a sugar thermometer and cook, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 149°C. If it looks like the caramel is burning in spots, gently and carefully swirl the pan."}, {"step": "Whisk the warm cream and butter mixture into your caramel and continue to cook until the mixture reaches 120°C. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and sea salt. Pour into the prepared tin; leave to cool completely at room temperature then chill for 1 hour – this will make the caramels easier to cut."}, {"step": "Turn the caramel out of the tin; remove and discard the parchment, then use a lightly greased knife to cut into pieces. Wrap individually in squares of waxed paper. Store the caramels in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "287kJ 69kcals", "Fat": "3.8g", "Saturated Fat": "2.4g", "Carbohydrate": "8.5g", "Sugars": "8.5g", "Protein": "0.1g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/rosemary Sea salt caramels.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
