Alternatively, place all the ingredients into a blender and blitz until smooth. Cover and set aside for up to 1 hour, or until ready to use."}, {"step": "Heat a 20cm frying pan over a medium heat, then test the pan by ladling in a small amount of batter. It should take around 1 minute to brown on the bottom. If it browns too quickly, lower the temperature slightly, and do the opposite if it cooks too slowly and becomes rubbery."}, {"step": "When the pan is at the right temperature, add in a small knob of butter and then pour in a ladleful of batter. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom, then allow the pancake to cook for 1 minute on each side, or until cooked through. Keep covered and warm in a low oven while you fry the rest."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,042kJ 249kcals", "Fat": "13.9g", "Saturated Fat": "7.8g", "Carbohydrate": "21.9g", "Sugars": "3.5g", "Protein": "8.7g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/Martha-Basic-Pancake_181440.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
