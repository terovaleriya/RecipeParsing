Mix the tamarind paste, sugar, fish sauce and crushed chillies with 1 tbsp water; set aside.  Heat the groundnut oil in a wok over a medium-high heat. Add the shallots and prawns and cook for 1-2 minutes until the shallots are just starting to colour. Add the eggs and stir for 30 seconds; then add the drained noodles and fry for 30 seconds, stirring to break up the egg.  Pour in the tamarind mixture and simmer until it is absorbed, then add the salad onions, bean sprouts and mange tout; fry for 1 minute.  Stir through half the coriander and half the peanuts. Garnish with the remaining coriander leaves, nuts and lime wedges.
