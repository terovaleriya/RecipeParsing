Gently heat the sugar, cream, maple syrup and butter in a large pan until the sugar dissolves. Simmer briskly, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches 116 ̊C (soft- ball stage) on a sugar thermometer; alternatively place a drop of the mixture into iced water to see if it produces a soft, pliable ball. Remove the pan from the heat, add the salt and set aside for 2 minutes. Beat the fudge vigorously with a wooden spoon for 3-5 minutes until it has lost its gloss and thickened but is still pourable. Stir through the pecans and pour into the prepared tin; cool completely. Cut into small squares to serve. The fudge will keep for up to 5 days in an airtight container."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "370Kj 89Kcal", "Fat": "4.9g", "Saturated Fat": "2.3g", "Carbohydrate": "10.8g", "Sugars": "10.7g", "Protein": "0.3g", "Salt": "1.0g", "Fibre": "0.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/Maple pecan fudge.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
