Add the garlic and thyme, then the spinach, peas and a splash of water. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the spinach is wilted and the peas are tender."}, {"step": "Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then add the spinach and pea mixture, plus the parsley. Mix well and season. Wipe out the pan with kitchen paper and heat the remaining 2 tsp oil. When hot, add the egg mixture. Swirl the pan until the mixture starts to set around the edges, then reduce the heat and cook on a very low heat for 4-5 minutes, until it just starts to set, with the bottom and sides golden but the middle still quite loose."}, {"step": "Cover the pan with a flat lid or board and carefully turn the tortilla onto it. (Don’t worry if it’s quite runny; it will come back together again.) Gently slide the tortilla back into the pan then put back on a low heat. Use a spatula to tuck the edges of the tortilla under to give it a curved look. Cook for 2-3 minutes over a medium-low heat, then turn onto a board and serve. It should still be a little soft and liquid in the middle. Enjoy with crusty bread and a tomato salad, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,633kJ 391kcals", "Fat": "20g", "Saturated Fat": "4.4g", "Carbohydrate": "16g", "Sugars": "4.5g", "Protein": "22g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "11g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/g/Green-tortilla.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
