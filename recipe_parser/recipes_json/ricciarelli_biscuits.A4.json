In a food processor, blend all the ingredients except the egg whites until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. Whisk the egg whites until stiff. Stir them into the almond mixture to form a soft dough.  Sprinkle icing sugar over the work surface and roll the dough with lightly dusted hands into a flat sausage roughly 2.5cm high and 5cm wide. Cut the sausage into 1cm-thick slices and place on the baking trays. Dust with icing sugar and bake for 18–20 minutes or until they are the colour of straw. Cool on a wire rack and dust with more icing sugar."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "426.768kJ 102.0kcal", "Fat": "5.1g", "Saturated Fat": "0.5g", "Sugars": "10.2g", "Salt": "0.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/0803034-r04.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
