Roll out the pastry and use to line two 12cm tart tins. Prick the bases and chill for 10 minutes. Place some crumpled foil in the pastry shells. Put the cases on a baking sheet, bake for 8 minutes, remove the foil and cook for 1-2 minutes.  Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan and gently cook the onions for 10-15 minutes until very soft.  Beat together the cream and eggs, and season. Spoon the onions and cheese into the pastry cases and pour over the cream mixture. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the filling is just set.  For the dressing: place the garlic, walnuts and chilli flakes in a small food processor and whizz together until finely chopped. Add the oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, sugar and season to taste, then whizz to make a fairly smooth, creamy dressing. Stir in the tarragon.  Let the tarts rest for 5 minutes, remove from the tins and serve, with the dressing."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "3631.712kJ 868.0kcal", "Fat": "69.6g", "Saturated Fat": "25.0g", "Sugars": "7.4g", "Salt": "1.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/05xmas14-r07.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
