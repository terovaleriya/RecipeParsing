Crack the egg into the well and whisk the mixture together, incorporating all the flour into the egg. Gradually add the milk, whisking until you have a smooth batter. Cover and set aside.  Place the rhubarb in a small pan with the cardamom pods, sugar and 50ml cold water. Heat gently, stirring occasionally, to dissolve the sugar, then simme for 4-5 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender. Remove from the heat, discard the cardamom pods and keep the rhubarb warm.  Heat a little of the butter in a 20cm crÃªpe pan or small non-stick frying pan. Add a small ladleful of the batter and swirl around to coat the base of the pan. Cook over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes or until the mixture has just set underneath, then flip over and cook for a further minute. Repeat with the remaining mixture to make 6 pancakes, keeping the cooked pancakes warm on a covered plate.  Fold the pancakes into quarters and spoon the rhubarb mixture over. Serve with a dollop of fromage frais."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "891.192kJ 213.0kcal", "Fat": "9.6g", "Saturated Fat": "5.5g", "Sugars": "10.7g", "Salt": "0.2g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0702r08.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
