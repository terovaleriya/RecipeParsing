As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, prick it several times with a skewer, then slowly pour the lemon drizzle all over the top, letting it soak into the cake. Leave to cool completely in the tin before turning out."}, {"step": "For the candied lemons, dissolve the sugar in a saucepan with 150ml water. In a separate pan, cook the lemon slices in briskly simmering water for 2 minutes, then drain.
