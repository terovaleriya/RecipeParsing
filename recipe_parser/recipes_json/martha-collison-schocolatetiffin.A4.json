Crush the digestive biscuits to crumbs, either using a food processor or a bowl and wooden spoon. You’re looking for a rubbly mixture with a few pea-sized pieces of biscuit remaining to give the tiffin some texture. Combine the crumbs with the cocoa powder and dried fruits – roughly chop any larger pieces of fruit so they combine well."}, {"step": "In a small pan, melt the butter and golden syrup together until smooth. Add a pinch of sea salt and then pour into the dry ingredients. Stir together until everything is really well mixed, tip into the lined tin and use a spatula to press the mixture firmly into an even layer. Chill for 20 minutes."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, melt both chocolates together in a bowl over a pan of simmering water until smooth. Pour the melted chocolate over the chilled base and tilt the tin to get an even covering, then chill for around 30-60 minutes, until firm. Slice into squares and store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,145kJ 274kcals", "Fat": "15.1g", "Saturated Fat": "8.3g", "Carbohydrate": "30.9g", "Sugars": "21.2g", "Protein": "2.8g", "Salt": "0.6g", "Fibre": "1.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/WRWK250118-Martha-tiffin-and-garibaldi.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
