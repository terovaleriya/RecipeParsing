Line a 1 litre (15cm x 7.5cm) loaf tin with buttered, non-stick baking parchment or silicone paper. Whisk the egg, oil and sugar together until thick. Slice 2 bananas finely and whisk into the mixture. Set aside 1 tbsp of the oats; fold in the remaining ingredients until the mixture is smooth.  Pour the batter into the prepared tin and sprinkle the surface with the reserved oats.  Slice the remaining banana and arrange the pieces on top, or use the dried chips.  Bake for 40–50 minutes or until golden.  The cake is done when a metal skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Allow the tea bread to cool in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1309.592kJ 313.0kcal", "Fat": "13.0g", "Saturated Fat": "2.5g", "Sugars": "29.2g", "Salt": "0.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/0804058-r05.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
