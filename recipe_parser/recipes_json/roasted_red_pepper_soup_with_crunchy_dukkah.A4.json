Place the peppers, carrot and onion in a large roasting tin. Drizzle with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil, season generously and toss everything together well. Place in the oven and roast for about 35 minutes, stirring halfway through, until the vegetables are tender and caramelised.  Meanwhile, place all the dukkah ingredients in a frying pan and toast over a gentle heat until the mustard seeds start to pop. Leave to cool, then transfer to a food processor and pulse until coarsely ground. Transfer to a bowl to cool.  In the same food processor bowl, place the roasted vegetables with any juices from the roasting tin and blitz to a smooth paste. Add the hot vegetable stock and carefully blitz until you have a smooth soup. Add more stock if the mixture is too thick. Leave to cool."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "535.552kJ 128.0kcal", "Fat": "9.1g", "Saturated Fat": "1.4g", "Sugars": "8.6g", "Salt": "0.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/r/0609as05-r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
