Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until stiff. Sprinkle over half the sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, whisking well after each addition, until you have a smooth, glossy mixture. Whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar in a separate bowl for several minutes until really pale and mousse-like, then stir in the lemon zest. Fold the egg yolk mixture into the egg whites in two batches, then fold in the flour 1 tbsp at a time. Finally, fold in the apples.  Transfer the mixture to the lined cake tin, smooth the surface and bake for 40-45 minutes until light golden brown and firm to the touch. In the meantime, gently heat the jam and the lemon juice in a small saucepan until the mixture loosens, then press it through a sieve.  When cool enough to handle, remove the cake from the tin. Serve warm or cold with a drizzle of the sauce. Accompany with some half-fat crème fraîche if you like."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1146.416kJ 274.0kcal", "Fat": "3.5g", "Saturated Fat": "0.9g", "Sugars": "44.0g", "Salt": "0.14g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/a/201102ed39r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
