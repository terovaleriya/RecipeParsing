A spoonful of garlic mayonnaise is also a nice addition."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2250kJ 536kcals", "Fat": "19g", "Saturated Fat": "2.9g", "Carbohydrate": "43g", "Sugars": "24g", "Protein": "42g", "Salt": "1.1g salt", "Fibre": "14g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/New recipes/4983-SearedTuna-WhiteBean-Salad.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
