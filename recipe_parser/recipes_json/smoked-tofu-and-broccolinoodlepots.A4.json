Place the finely chopped broccoli stalks in a covered saucepan with the dashi (and stock if using) and bring to the boil.  Add the small florets and chopped chilli mixture to the pan, stir and cook for 3 minutes. Drop in the noodle nests, adding extra water if necessary to cover them completely, then bring to the boil again.  Add the tofu, cover and remove from the heat.  Leave for 4 minutes. Season to taste and serve immediately with a little chilli sauce, if you wish."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "979kj 232kcals", "Fat": "6g", "Saturated Fat": "1.4g", "Carbohydrate": "27.5g", "Sugars": "2.5g", "Protein": "17g", "Salt": "1.1g", "Fibre": "4.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Tofu-broccoli-noodle-pot-2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
