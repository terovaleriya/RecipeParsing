Heat 100ml milk in a saucepan until boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in 150g Toblerone. Set aside.  Mix together the flour, baking powder, cocoa, 75g sugar and the rest of the Toblerone. In a separate bowl, whisk 25g butter, the egg and the remaining milk together. Mix this into the dry ingredients. Divide into 6 x 200ml ovenproof dishes. Spoon the Toblerone sauce on top. Bake for 20 minutes, until it rises and is set on the top but wobbly underneath.  For the caramel sauce, place the sugar and 3 tbsp water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved. Continue to cook until it turns a deep gold, swirling the pan so it colours evenly. Pour in the cream. It will hiss, and the sugar may 'seize', or form into lumps. If this happens, continue to heat it until it melts. Stir in 15g butter and the vanilla. Set aside.  To serve, place each pudding on a plate to catch the drips and scoop a spoonful of cold crème fraîche on top. Finally, drizzle with the caramel sauce."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2355.592kJ 563.0kcal", "Fat": "32.5g", "Saturated Fat": "19.5g", "Sugars": "49.2g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/t/0604060-r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
