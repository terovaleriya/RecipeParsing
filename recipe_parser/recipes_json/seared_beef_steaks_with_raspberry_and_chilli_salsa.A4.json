Stir in the herbs.  Add the vinegar and 1 tablespoon of the oil and season with freshly ground black pepper. Use a fork to gently crush some of the raspberries and allow the juice to seep into the salsa. Set aside in a cool place (but preferably not the fridge) until ready to serve.  Cook the rice according to pack instructions.  Meanwhile, brush the steaks with the remaining oil and season. Heat a ridged griddle pan or non-stick frying pan until very hot then sear the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking (less for rare, more for well done).  Serve the steaks hot from the pan with a good dollop of the salsa and a helping of rice. Garnish with the reserved, torn mint leaves."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1820.04kJ 435.0kcal", "Fat": "9.3g", "Saturated Fat": "1.7g", "Sugars": "4.8g", "Salt": "trace"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0605r05.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
