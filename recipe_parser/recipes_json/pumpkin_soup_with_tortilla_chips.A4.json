Add the paprika and cook for a minute more.  Add the pumpkin or squash and stock, then bring to the boil. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes or until the squash is very tender. Remove from the heat and purée with a hand-held blender until smooth and velvety.  When ready to serve, gently reheat the soup, stirring in the cream towards the end. Once piping hot, ladle the soup into bowls or large mugs and sprinkle over some crushed tortillas and Gruyère. Let everyone add their own Tabasco, according to taste."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1092.024kJ 261.0kcal", "Fat": "17.7g", "Saturated Fat": "8.4g", "Sugars": "6.0g", "Salt": "1.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0909ss40r2.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
