Melt the butter in a saucepan or microwave. Blitz the custard creams in a food processor until they resemble fine crumbs, and then pour the melted butter into the processor and blitz again. Press the crumbs into the base of the lined tin, pushing it right into the edges to get an even layer using the back of a spoon. Place the base into the fridge to chill."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 170°C, gas mark 3. Beat together the soft cheese, sugar, double cream and vanilla (if using) in a large bowl until it is smooth."}, {"step": "Mix the custard powder with the milk in a small bowl to make a thick paste, then beat into the cream cheese mixture. Add the eggs and egg yolks and stir gently, trying not to incorporate too much air."}, {"step": "Remove the base from the fridge and wrap the bottom in a double layer of tin foil so the cheesecake doesn’t leak. Place the tin into a roasting tray and boil a kettle."}, {"step": "Pour the cheesecake mixture onto the chilled base. Fill the roasting tray with boiling water until it reaches halfway up the cheesecake tin. Bake the cheesecake for 45-60 minutes, or until the top feels set with a slight wobble in the centre."}, {"step": "Remove the cheesecake from the water, unwrap the foil and allow to cool completely at room temperature. Chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours or overnight."}, {"step": "When you’re ready to serve, whip the double cream to soft peaks. Remove the cheesecake from the tin. Top with the cream and a few whole and crushed custard creams."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2,711kJ 652kcals", "Fat": "49g", "Saturated Fat": "28.8g", "Carbohydrate": "43.7g", "Sugars": "28g", "Protein": "9.1g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "0.6g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/WRWK150916-Martha-custard-cheesecake.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
