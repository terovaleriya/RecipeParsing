Once smooth, divide the mixture between four champagne flutes. Add 10ml Aperol to each glass and mix very briefly to give an ombre effect, lighter at the top and pinker at the bottom. Serve immediately."}], "nutrition": null, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Sgroppino-spritz.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
