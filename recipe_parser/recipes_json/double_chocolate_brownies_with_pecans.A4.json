Grease a 23cm x 32cm baking tray and line with baking parchment. In a small pan, gently melt together the butter and plain chocolate, stirring regularly until smooth; remove from the heat and set aside to cool slightly.  Meanwhile, roughly chop the pecans and white chocolate and set aside. Put the eggs, sugar and vanilla essence in a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk for 5 minutes until light and fluffy.  Stir the melted chocolate mix into the egg mixture, then fold in the flour, followed by the pecans and white chocolate. Pour into the prepared baking tray and cook for 25–30 minutes. Test with a skewer – the mixture should still be gooey and not quite cooked in the middle. Allow to cool, then cut into 16 slices."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1204.992kJ 288.0kcal", "Fat": "17.0g", "Saturated Fat": "8.0g", "Sugars": "21.0g", "Salt": "trace"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/d/201006WKED41r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
