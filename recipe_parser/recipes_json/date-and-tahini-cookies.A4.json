The dates will mostly break down. Beat in the egg, followed by the tahini, vanilla and a pinch of salt. Stir in the flour, bicarbonate of soda and 1 tbsp sesame seeds to make a soft dough. Cover and chill for 15 minutes to firm up slightly."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 180˚C, gas mark 4. Put the remaining sesame seeds on a plate. Roll heaped teaspoons of dough into spheres – it should make 30 or so – and roll in the seeds to lightly coat.

Leave to firm up on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then cool on a wire rack."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per cookie 562kJ 134kcals", "Fat": "6.6g", "Saturated Fat": "2.5g", "Carbohydrate": "15g", "Sugars": "11g", "Protein": "2.5g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "1.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/d/Date-and-tahini-cookies.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
