Place paper cake cases in a 12-hole bun tin. Beat the butter and sugar together with an electric whisk or wooden spoon for 2-3 minutes until pale and creamy. Beat in the ginger, vanilla and golden syrup until combined.  Gradually add a little flour and some of the egg, beating well after each addition. Repeat until all the flour and egg has been added. Spoon into the paper cases and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until golden and well risen. Place on a wire rack to cool.  Make the icing just before you are ready to ice the cakes. Melt the butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to the boil, add the cream and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and beat in the icing sugar until smooth. If the icing becomes too stiff, add a tablespoon of boiling water and beat again. Spread the icing over the cakes and decorate with chunks of fudge, or crystallised stem ginger."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "924.664kJ 221kcals", "Fat": "10.3g", "Saturated Fat": "6.1g", "Carbohydrate": "29.8g", "Sugars": "23.4g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/t/2013wkwe-October-r8fudgycake.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
