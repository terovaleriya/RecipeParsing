Add 900ml cold water, bring to the boil then simmer, covered with a lid just ajar to prevent the pan from boiling over, for 15 minutes until the lentils are almost tender."}, {"step": "Stir in the cubed potato, plus two strips of pared lemon zest (do this with a vegetable peeler. You’ll need 4-5 strips in total) and ½ tsp salt. Add another 300ml water, then simmer for 15-20 minutes until the potato is tender. The soup should be fairly loose."}, {"step": "Stir in the cavolo nero, simmer for 3 minutes or until just wilted, then season with the juice of half a lemon and salt and pepper – it’s likely you’ll need another good pinch of salt to round out the flavours."}, {"step": "Heat the oil in a small pan, add the sliced garlic, remaining chilli flakes and cumin seeds plus a couple more strips of lemon zest. Sizzle gently for 2 minutes, until the garlic is golden, the seeds toasted and the oil reddish in colour from the chillies. Drizzle a little over the soup, and finish with the coriander. Serve with the remaining lemon in wedges for squeezing over."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,126kJ 268kcal", "Fat": "7.5g", "Saturated Fat": "0.6g", "Carbohydrate": "35g", "Sugars": "6.8g", "Protein": "9.6g", "Salt": "0.1g", "Fibre": "8.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/l/Lemon-Lentil-Soup-Spices-&-kale.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
