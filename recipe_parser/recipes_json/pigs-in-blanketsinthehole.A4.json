Twist each chipolata in the middle, and cut into two small sausages. Stretch the rashers of bacon out with the flat of a knife and cut each into three slices. Wrap each sausage in a piece of bacon. Take a 12-hole muffin tray and drizzle a little oil into the base of each hole. Then divide the sliced leek between the holes, and top with two of the little bacon-wrapped sausages. Cook in the hot oven for 12-15 minutes until just starting to brown."}, {"step": "While the sausages are cooking, sift the flour into a bowl and season. Whisk in the eggs and milk to make a smooth batter.

Serve with creamy mashed potato, steamed green beans and, if you wish, an extra spoonful of onion marmalade."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,553kJ 372kcals", "Fat": "20.8g", "Saturated Fat": "6.8g", "Carbohydrate": "22.3g", "Sugars": "9.4g", "Protein": "23.8g", "Salt": "1.7g", "Fibre": "1.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/Waitrose-Wk'end_273_Duchy_Pigs-In-Blanket-in-the-Hole.gif/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
