Season and mix with an electric whisk for at least 3-5 minutes, or until smooth and frothy on the surface. Mix in the horseradish sauce. Pour the batter into a jug and leave to stand at room temperature for 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 220Â°C, gas mark 7. Divide the oil between a 4-hole 100ml Yorkshire pudding tray. Place in the oven for about 10 minutes or until the oil just begins to smoke. Pour the batter into the tin. Cook for 15 minutes or until risen and golden.  Meanwhile, place a large frying pan over a high heat. Add half of the butter and the beef. Stir-fry for 5 minutes or until browned. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate and set aside in a warm place. Heat the beef stock.  Return the pan to the heat and add the onion. Cook for 5 minutes or until golden. Pour in the wine and bring to the boil for 1 minute or until almost all the liquid has evaporated. Add the stock and boil for a further 5 minutes, or until reduced slightly. Stir in the remaining butter to create a glossy gravy. Mix in the reserved meat and season to taste.  Transfer the cooked puddings to serving plates and spoon the meat mixture into the centre of each. Pour over any remaining gravy. Serve immediately, with extra horseradish and steamed shredded greens or cabbage."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1711.256kJ 409.0kcal", "Fat": "21.9g", "Saturated Fat": "8.0g", "Sugars": "6.7g", "Salt": "1.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/050939r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
