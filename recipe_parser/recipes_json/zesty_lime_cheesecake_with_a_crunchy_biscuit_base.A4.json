Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the crushed biscuits. Press the mixture into the base of the prepared sandwich tin and chill.  In a bowl, dissolve the jelly in 100ml boiling water. Stir with a spoon then set aside to cool.  Meanwhile, whisk the evaporated milk in a large bowl using an electric or balloon whisk, until light and fluffy, and doubled in volume. Then whisk in the cream cheese until smooth and well combined.  Take the finely grated zest and juice of 2 of the limes. Finely slice the remaining lime and set aside. Add all the juice and half of the zest to the cream cheese mix then whisk in the jelly. (Keep the rest of the zest chilled.) Pour over the biscuit base and chill for 2 hours or until set. Decorate with the reserved lime zest and slices of lime."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "995.792kJ 238.0kcal", "Fat": "11.0g", "Saturated Fat": "6.4g", "Sugars": "21.8g", "Salt": "0.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/z/1-Lime-Cheesecake_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
