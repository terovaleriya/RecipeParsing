Line a sieve with muslin and set it over a mixing bowl. Mix the salt into the yogurt then spoon it into the muslin. Gather all the sides together and tie in a knot or tie tightly with string. Leaving the sieve over the bowl, transfer to the fridge for 18-24 hours. (You don’t need the liquid that collects in the bowl, but it can be whizzed into smoothies.)"}, {"step": "When ready to serve, set a griddle pan over a high heat. Toss the Tenderstem in the oil and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side until nicely charred (you may need to do this in batches), then transfer to a mixing bowl. Drizzle over the lemon juice and season. Open the muslin and spoon the labneh onto a serving plate with the dressed Tenderstem alongside. Drizzle with a little extra oil and sprinkle over the dukkah to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "743kJ 179", "Fat": "11", "Saturated Fat": "4.4", "Carbohydrate": "6.6", "Sugars": "4.6", "Protein": "12", "Salt": "0.7", "Fibre": "4.3"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/g/Griddled-Tenderstem-broccoli,-labneh-and-dukkah.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
