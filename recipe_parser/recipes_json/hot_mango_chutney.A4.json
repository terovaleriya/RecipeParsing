Cut  away the skin and roughly chop the flesh, including the flesh  clinging to the stones.  Put the chopped mangoes in a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat.  Cover and simmer gently for about 30 minutes until the mangoes are very tender and the juices are thick and syrupy, removing  the lid half way through. (If the juices are still very runny once the mangoes are tender, increase the heat a little, with the lid off, so  the liquid can reduce.)  Ladle into thoroughly clean jars while still hot (wide-necked preserving jars, particularly those with metal lids or rubber seals  and clip-top lids, are ideal). Finish with decorative labels."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "117.152kJ 28.0kcal", "Fat": "0.1g", "Sugars": "6.7g", "Salt": "trace"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/h/0903ss29r02.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
