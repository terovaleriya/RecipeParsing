{"title": "Mango tarte tatin with coconut cream", "tags": [{"tag": "Vegetarian"}], "planning": {"prep_time": "PT25M", "cook_time": "PT35M", "total_time": "PT60M", "serves": "6"}, "ingredients": [{"item": "40g slightly salted butter, plus extra to grease"}, {"item": "100g caster sugar, plus 2 tbsp"}, {"item": "1 pack Waitrose Perfectly Ripe Mango (2)"}, {"item": "Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lime"}, {"item": "375g pack all butter puff pastry"}, {"item": "flour, for dusting"}, {"item": "½ x 160ml can coconut cream"}, {"item": "170ml pot double cream"}], "instructions": [{"step": "Grease and base line a 22-23cm shallow round baking tin with greaseproof paper. Put the 100g sugar in a small, heavy-based saucepan with 3 tbsp water and leave to soften while preparing the mangoes. Halve the fruits either side of the flat stone, cut away the skin and slice the flesh. Place in the baking tin, piling the slices up slightly in the centre."}, {"step": "Gently heat the sugar, stirring frequently until dissolved. Bring to the boil and boil until the syrup turns to a pale caramel, then dip the base of the pan briefly in cold water to stop further cooking. Add the lime juice and zest with the butter. Return to the heat and cook gently, stirring as the mixture softens to make a smooth, caramel sauce. Spoon about half the sauce over the mangoes in the tin."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 200ºC, gas mark 6. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until large enough to cut out a 25cm circle, using a bowl or plate as a guide. Position the pastry circle over the mango mixture, tucking the edges down inside the tin to encase the filling. Bake for 25 minutes until the pastry is risen and golden."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, place the coconut cream and double cream in a bowl with the 2 tbsp sugar and beat with a handheld electric whisk until thickened. Transfer to a serving dish."}, {"step": "When the tarte is cooked, loosen the edges of the pastry away from the tin and invert onto a serving plate. Spoon over the remaining caramel, heating it through first if it has solidified. Serve with the coconut cream."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2451.824kJ 586kcals", "Fat": "39.3g", "Saturated Fat": "23.4g", "Carbohydrate": "53.5g", "Sugars": "33.4g", "Salt": "0.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/m/tart-tartin_2048x2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
