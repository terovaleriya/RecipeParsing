Peel the potatoes (reserving the peelings for the gratin, see page 94) then cut each into 3-4 chunks so they are all roughly the same size. Put them in a large pan and cover with cold, salted water. Cover and bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, put the oil (or goose fat or dripping) in a large roasting tin and put in the oven to heat up."}, {"step": "Drain the potatoes in a colander and leave to steam-dry for 2-3 minutes, then tip back into the dry pan. With the lid on, shake the pan to roughen up the edges. In a small bowl, mix the garlic and onion granules with the salt. Add to the potatoes, cover and shake again to coat evenly."}, {"step": "When the fat is hot, carefully tip the potatoes into the tin. Turn them to coat in the fat, add the bay leaves and roast for 1 hour-1 hour 10 minutes, shaking the tin halfway through, until golden and crisp.
