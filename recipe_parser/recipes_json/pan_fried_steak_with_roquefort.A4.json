Set aside.  Preheat a heavy-based frying pan until very hot. Add the sunflower oil then the steaks cooking for 21/2 minutes each side for rare, 4 minutes each side for medium rare, and 6-7 minutes for well done, turning once.  When the meat is cooked to your liking remove from the pan, season, then cover and leave to rest on a warm plate while finishing off the dish.  Pour the whisky or bourbon into the hot frying pan and bubble away, scraping any meat juices from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Take extreme care, as the whisky could easily ignite if overheated.  Toss together the watercress and red onion and place on two serving plates. Lay the steaks on top and top with a large spoonful of the Roquefort butter. Spoon over the hot pan juices and serve with Waitrose Frozen Jacket Scallop Potatoes."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1677.784kJ 401.0kcal", "Fat": "24.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0102r01.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
