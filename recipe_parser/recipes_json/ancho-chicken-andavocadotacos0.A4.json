Remove the chicken from the fridge at least 30 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature."}, {"step": "Preheat the grill to medium. Wipe any excess marinade off the chicken and put on a foil-lined baking tray. Grill for 30-40 minutes on a low shelf until it looks crisp and is thoroughly cooked, the juices run clear and no pink meat remains. Put the tortillas in the oven, directly on the shelf, for 2-3 minutes to warm through (or lightly char in a griddle pan). Meanwhile, carefully take the meat off the bones and put it on a large plate. Let guests serve themselves, loading the warm tortillas with the chicken, avocado, coriander and red onion, plus lime wedges for squeezing over."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (6) 2481kJ 594kcals", "Fat": "34g", "Saturated Fat": "8.2g", "Carbohydrate": "34g", "Sugars": "7.1g", "Protein": "35g", "Salt": "2g", "Fibre": "2.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/a/Ancho-chicken-tacos.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
