Fry the bay leaf and cardamom pods for 30 seconds. Add the onions and cook for 12-15 minutes, until golden brown. Add the garlic, chilli and ginger and stir for 1 minute. Next, add the tomatoes and sauté for 8-10 minutes until the mixture starts coming together and turns darker."}, {"step": "Add the sugar, salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric and chilli powder. Cook for another few minutes, mixing well. Add the chickpeas and 350ml water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer over a low-medium heat for 20 minutes, adding a little just-boiled water if it starts to get too dry. Remove the lid; cook for about 5 minutes more, to thicken the sauce slightly. Add the garam masala and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the lemon juice and chopped coriander leaves, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve scattered with extra coriander leaves and flatbreads on the side, if liked, warning everyone about the whole spices."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1151kJ 275kcals", "Fat": "12g fat", "Saturated Fat": "0.9g", "Carbohydrate": "28g", "Sugars": "7.9g", "Protein": "10g", "Salt": "1.6g", "Fibre": "7.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/c/wf121120_rogan_ChickpeaCurry_8990_Hero_RT.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
