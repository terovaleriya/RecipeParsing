In a large bowl, whisk the vinegar, honey, yogurt, ginger, caraway seeds and mustard with some salt and pepper, until smooth.  Brush the steaks with olive oil and press one side into the cracked pepper. Sear in a hot pan until crusty but still pink inside, turning once, and rest for 5 minutes in a warm place.  Blanch the cabbage in a big pot of salted, boiling water for 1 minute, then drain well. Toss in the dressing to coat and arrange on warm plates; serve any extra in a bowl. Slice the steak and arrange on top. Scatter with the parsley."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1522.976kJ 364.0kcal", "Fat": "19.3g", "Saturated Fat": "6.2g", "Sugars": "7.1g", "Salt": "0.7g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0801075-r04.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
