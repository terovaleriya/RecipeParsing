Grease a 20cm-round loose-bottomed cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. Place the almonds in a food processor and whizz until finely ground.  Place the egg yolks, sugar, lemon zest and juice in a large bowl and whisk with an electric or hand whisk until the mixture becomes thick, creamy and pale. Mix in the almonds and cinnamon.  Place the egg whites in a clean, dry bowl and whisk with an electric or hand whisk until they form stiff peaks. Using a metal tablespoon, lightly fold 2 tablespoons of the egg white into the almond mixture to loosen it slightly, then gently fold in the remaining egg white, until the mixture is thoroughly combined. Pour into the tin and bake for 45 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin.  While the torte is cooling, make the syrup. Reserve a few pieces of lemon zest for decoration. Place the rest with the juice, sugar and 1 tablespoon of cold water in a small saucepan. Heat gently until the sugar has dissolved. Spoon the warm syrup over the top of the torte. Just before serving, dust with the icing sugar, then cut into slices and serve with a dollop of lightly whipped cream or natural yogurt, decorated with the reserved lemon zest."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1803.304kJ 431.0kcal", "Fat": "25.5g", "Saturated Fat": "2.8g", "Salt": "0.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0508r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
