Bring the milk to the boil in a saucepan, add the potatoes and onion and cook for 10 minutes or until almost tender.  Bring the milk to the boil in a saucepan, add the potatoes and onion and cook for 10 minutes or until almost tender. Strain, reserving the milk, and allow to cool slightly. Mix together the crème fraîche, chopped herbs and 8 tbsp of the reserved milk and season.  Lightly grease a shallow ovenproof dish and arrange half the sliced potatoes and onions inside. Pour half the crème fraîche mixture over the top. Repeat, then drizzle with the melted butter.  Cook for 30 minutes in the oven, until the potato is tender and some of the sauce is absorbed. About 10 minutes before the potato is cooked, heat the griddle pan until really hot then place the steaks in the pan, pepper side down. Leave the steaks untouched for 3 minutes, sprinkle a little salt on top, then turn over to cook for a further 3-4 minutes (they will be just pink in the middle). Serve with the potatoes and some lightly cooked asparagus spears or dwarf spring,"}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "3535.48kJ 845.0kcal", "Fat": "55.0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0005r03.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
