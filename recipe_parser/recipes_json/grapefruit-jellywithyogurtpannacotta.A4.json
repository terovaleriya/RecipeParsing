For the yogurt panna cotta, put the cream, milk and sugar in a pan and heat until almost bubbling, then remove from the heat. Put the gelatine in a small bowl of water. After 10 minutes, when the cream is still just warm to the touch, take the gelatine out of the water and squeeze to remove the excess liquid. Stir it into the cream with the yogurt and lemon juice. Strain through a fine sieve into a metal bowl. Set over a bowl of iced water; gently stir until the mixture begins to thicken slightly. Take care to scrape the bottom of the bowl to ensure even cooling and be gentle to avoid creating air bubbles. Pour into the dariole moulds; chill for 1 hour to set."}, {"step": "For the jelly, put the sugar, 50ml juice and 20ml water in a saucepan and put over a low heat (it’s really important that the juice is freshly squeezed and strained so that it remains clear when set). Stir well to help dissolve the sugar; do not allow to boil. Put the gelatine sheets in a bowl of cold water and leave to soften for 5 minutes."}, {"step": "When the sugar has dissolved and the juice is warm to the touch, remove from the heat. Take the gelatine out of the water and squeeze to remove the excess liquid. Stir it into the warm juice until dissolved and combined. Add the remaining 230ml juice and stir gently. Strain through a fine sieve into a metal bowl and set over a bowl of iced water. Stir gently until starting to thicken (this could take about 15 minutes). Tip into a jug and pour over the panna cotta. Return to the fridge to set for 2 hours. To serve, dip the base of the dariole moulds into a bowl of warm water and turn out onto a plate. Serve with the the grapefruit segments arranged alongside."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,263kJ 301kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "6.9g", "Carbohydrate": "37g", "Sugars": "37g", "Protein": "7.6g", "Salt": "0.2g", "Fibre": "0.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/g/Grapefruit-Jelly.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
