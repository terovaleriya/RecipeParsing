Heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion and squash for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the squash is beginning to colour.  Add the oregano, garlic and tomatoes and cook gently for 5 minutes. Spoon a quarter of the butternut squash mixture into a shallow baking dish and spread in a thin layer.  Cover with 3 lasagne sheets, breaking them to fit where necessary.  Spoon over another quarter of the squash mixture and dot with about a third of the cheese sauce.  Add another 3 lasagne sheets then half the remaining squash mixture.  Arrange the rest of the lasagne sheets on top and spread with the remaining squash mixture.  Top with the rest of the cheese sauce, spreading it to cover the filling. Scatter over the Parmigiano Reggiano and bake for 50-60 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,730kj 411kcals", "Fat": "12.4g", "Saturated Fat": "5.9g", "Carbohydrate": "59.5g", "Sugars": "22.7g", "Protein": "15.3g", "Salt": "0.9g", "Fibre": "8.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/b/Butternut-tomato-lasagne-2048.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
