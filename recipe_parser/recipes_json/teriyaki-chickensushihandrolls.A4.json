Spread 1/8 of the sushi rice (about 50g) on the left half of one strip and arrange some sliced teriyaki chicken, avocado and salad onion on top. Sprinkle with a few sesame seeds, then roll up into a cone. Lightly wet the edge of the nori so it sticks together. Repeat to make 8 hand rolls. Serve with soy sauce and wasabi paste for dipping, if liked."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (2 rolls) 1407kJ 337kcals", "Fat": "10g", "Saturated Fat": "2.3g", "Carbohydrate": "32.7g", "Sugars": "7.7g", "Protein": "27.9g", "Salt": "2.75g", "Fibre": "2.0g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/t/Teriyaki-sushi-rolls.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
