Set this over a bowl. Let it drain for 24 hours, picking up the ‘bag’ occasionally and giving it a squeeze.  Put the wine (or 500ml water), lemon rind and juice, sugar and honey into a saucepan and bring to the boil, stirring now and then to help absorb. Turn down to a simmer and add the apricots to poach. Cook until the fruit yields to the point of a knife.  When the fruit is poached, remove it with a slotted spoon and boil the poaching syrup until reduced by a third. Remove the rind, then set the syrup aside to cool. Once it’s at room temperature, add the orange flower water and pour over the fruit. Chill for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.  Peel the cheesecloth from the labneh and serve, whole or torn into wedges, with the apricots spooned around it. Drizzle the labneh with a little more of the honey and scatter with the nuts."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1648.496kJ 394.0kcal", "Fat": "8.0g", "Saturated Fat": "4.0g", "Sugars": "62.0g", "Salt": "0.3g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/0907wfi84r1.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
