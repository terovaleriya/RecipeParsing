Put the oil in a non-stick frying pan set over a medium heat. Fry ½ tsp cumin and the mustard seeds for about 20 seconds, until they begin to sizzle. Add the shallots and ginger and cook for 5 minutes, stirring. Add the peas, curry powder, chilli powder and lemon juice; cook for 2 minutes. Add the swede then cook for 1 minute to coat in the spices. Remove from the heat, stir in the coriander and season; set aside."}, {"step": "Preheat the oven to 200˚C, gas mark 6. Unwrap the filo pastry; cover with cling film and a damp tea towel. Working with one sheet at a time, lay out on a clean surface and brush lightly with melted butter. Fold in 1 /3 of the pastry from one of the long sides, brush again with butter and fold in the other long side to make a long, triple-layered strip."}, {"step": "Place 1 /7 of the filling at one end of the strip. Fold one corner over to enclose the filling, so that the short edge now lies flush with the long edge, forming a triangle. Keep folding it up and across, keeping all the edges flush, to form a samosa. Brush the outside with butter to stick down any overhanging pastry at the end. Sprinkle over a few cumin seeds and put on a large baking sheet. Repeat to make 7 samosas. Bake in the centre of the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Serve with the mango chutney."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per samosa 1172kJ 280kcals", "Fat": "13g", "Saturated Fat": "6.3g", "Carbohydrate": "35g", "Sugars": "9.9g", "Protein": "5.1g", "Salt": "0.8g", "Fibre": "2.9g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Spiced-swede-samosa.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
