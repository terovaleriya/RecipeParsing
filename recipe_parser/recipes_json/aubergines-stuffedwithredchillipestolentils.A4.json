Leaving a 1cm border, use a sharp knife to score around the edge of the aubergine halves, taking care not to cut all the way through. Scoop out the insides with a spoon and set aside.

Roast for 20 minutes."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, heat the remaining ½ tbsp oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Roughly chop the scooped-out insides of the aubergine. Add to the pan with the onion.
