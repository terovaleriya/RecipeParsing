Grease and line a 1kg loaf tin. Cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds; score the flesh.

Set aside to cool slightly then peel and weigh out 300g cooked flesh. Thoroughly mash with a fork in a mixing bowl."}, {"step": "Add the fresh ginger, sugar, treacle, yogurt, oil, vanilla extract and eggs to the mashed squash and whisk well until smooth.
