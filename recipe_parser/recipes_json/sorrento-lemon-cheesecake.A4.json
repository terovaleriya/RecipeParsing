Meanwhile, grease a deep, loose-bottomed 18cm cake tin and line with baking parchment. Whizz the cantuccini in a food processor until they resemble fine breadcrumbs, then stir them into the melted butter with the salt. Tip into the prepared tin and press down firmly to create an even layer. Chill while you make the filling."}, {"step": "Line a bowl with a muslin cloth and tip in the yogurt. Tightly twist the ends of the cloth together around the yogurt and squeeze to press out the excess liquid – you should be left with about 300g yogurt. Transfer the yogurt to a mixing bowl and stir in the soft cheese, icing sugar, lemon zest and juice. Stir through 100g lemon curd until just combined."}, {"step": "Spread the cheesecake mixture over the biscuit base. Dot the remaining 20g curd on top, then, using a palette knife or the back of a spoon, draw it through the filling to create a swirl effect, taking care not to overmix. Chill for 3 hours, then remove from the tin and slice to serve."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "1,772kJ 425kcals", "Fat": "28g", "Saturated Fat": "17g", "Carbohydrate": "32g", "Sugars": "23g", "Protein": "10g", "Salt": "0.7g", "Fibre": "1.1g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Sorrento_Cheesecake_38.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
