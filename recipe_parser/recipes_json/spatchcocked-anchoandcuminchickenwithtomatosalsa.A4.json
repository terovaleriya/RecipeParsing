For the marinade, put the ancho chillies in a small saucepan, cover with boiling water and simmer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, gently toast the cumin seeds for a few minutes until fragrant, then grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar."}, {"step": "Once the chillies have simmered, open them out, discard the seeds and put in a small food processor with the cumin and the other marinade ingredients. Whizz to a purée and season, adding more salt, sugar or vinegar to taste. Rub all but 1 tsp over the chicken. Chill the bird for up to 24 hours to marinate, if liked, then roast, skin-side up, for 45 minutes or until cooked through."}, {"step": "Meanwhile, make the salsa. Put the onion in a mixing bowl and squeeze over the lime juice; set aside. Put the tomatoes in a heavy frying pan over a high heat with the garlic and jalapeno chilli. Dry-roast, turning regularly, for 10-15 minutes, until the ingredients are blackened all over (the garlic will only take 10 minutes)."}, {"step": "Remove everything from the pan, slip the garlic cloves out of their skins and de-stem the chilli. In a pestle and mortar, crush the tomatoes and garlic with the salt to a coarse purée (or whizz in a food processor). Add the sugar, herbs, vinegar, ½ the chilli and the 1 tsp reserved marinade; work into the purée. Stir in the red onion mixture. Check the seasoning – if you like spice add the rest of the chilli, and add more vinegar, sugar or salt to taste."}, {"step": "Check the chicken is cooked through by piercing the thigh with a sharp knife and making sure the juices run clear. Cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 15 minutes. Carve and serve with the salsa and salad"}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "Per serving (6) 1829kJ 438kcals", "Fat": "25g", "Saturated Fat": "6.1g", "Carbohydrate": "10g", "Sugars": "9.4g", "Protein": "40g", "Salt": "1.6g", "Fibre": "1.5g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/s/Spatchcocked-ancho-and-cumin-chicken.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
