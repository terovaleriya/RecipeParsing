Lightly grease a large baking sheet. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to 5mm thickness and trim to a rectangle measuring about 35cm x 22cm. Transfer to the baking sheet. Using the tip of a sharp knife, score a line around the edges of the pastry, about 1cm from the sides.  Thinly slice the peaches and arrange over the marzipan. Bake for about 25 minutes or until the pastry has risen to form a case and is a deep golden colour. Leave to stand for 10 minutes.  Melt the conserve in a saucepan with the lemon juice and brush over the filling and pastry crust. Serve warm or cold with a spoonful of ice cream, or a dollop of whipped cream."}], "nutrition": {"Energy": "2242.624kJ 536.0kcal", "Fat": "31.2g", "Saturated Fat": "10.4g", "Sugars": "38.3g", "Salt": "0.8g"}, "image_url": "//d1v30bmd12dhid.cloudfront.net/static/version6/content/dam/waitrose/recipes/images/p/0607ss26-r04.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.400.400.png"}
